The crypto market has steeply declined since January 20th, when Donald Trump assumed office as the U.S. president. The recent sell-offs have
seen Bitcoin and Ethereum dip sharply as investors liquidate their crypto holdings. Analysts believe the sell-off could result from macroeconomic
uncertainty in the U.S. following Trumpâ€™s proposed economic policies regarding tariffs and taxes. As the two crypto assets decline, Ethereum
and Bitcoin traders have shifted their focus to a new DeFi project with massive long term potential. Bitcoin price prediction Bitcoinâ€™s price
recently fell to a four-month low, dipping below $77,000 before recovering slightly above $80,000. As of this writing, the crypto asset is trading at
$83,414. Analysts have observed parallels between current market conditions and the end of the 2021 crypto bull market, suggesting a potential
further drop to $73,000. Despite the recent selloff, many believe Bitcoin is undergoing a temporary correction, and the asset is set to rebound
soon. Bitcoin could reclaim the $100k mark in May. Ethereum price prediction Ethereum (ETH) is trading at approximately $1,890 at the time of
this publication. The digital asset has suffered under the prevailing bearish market sentiment. However, Ethereum is still one of the most utilized
blockchain networks. Analysts expect a strong recovery once market conditions stabilize. The continued development of Ethereum Layer-2 scaling
solutions and potential ETF approvals could drive a price resurgence shortly. Ethereum could surge to an all-time high before the year
ends.According to analysts, Ethereum could see $2,800 sometime in April. Why BTC and ETH Traders Are Turning to BinoFi (BINO) As
Bitcoin and Ethereum remain under bearish pressure, investors seek alternative projects with strong growth potential. BinoFi (BINO) has emerged
as a compelling DeFi opportunity for presale investors. The project is gaining traction among BTC and ETH traders due to its hybrid exchange
model, cross-chain trading, gasless transactions, and high-yield staking incentives. Unlike traditional exchanges, BinoFi offers a hybrid model that
merges the speed and liquidity of centralized exchanges (CEXs) with the security and autonomy of decentralized exchanges (DEXs). This means
traders can enjoy fast trade execution without compromising transparency or security. This innovative model helps BinoFi solve the long-standing
problem of liquidity and efficiency that has plagued both CEXs and DEXs. BinoFiâ€™s cross-chain compatibility is another major draw. The
feature allows users to trade assets across multiple blockchain ecosystems without limitations. Gasless transactions significantly reduce costs,
making trading more efficient and affordable. With Ethereum gas fees fluctuating unpredictably, many traders are eager to adopt a new platform
that eliminates unnecessary transaction expenses and has lightning-fast transaction speeds. High-Yield Staking and Passive Income Beyond trading,
BinoFi offers lucrative staking rewards, providing passive income opportunities for investors. Given the current market uncertainty, BTC and ETH
holders are increasingly looking for ways to earn yield on their holdings without taking excessive risks. BinoFiâ€™s staking program offers an
attractive alternative, enabling traders to maximize their earnings while stabilizing the market. One of the most compelling reasons traders are
flocking to BinoFi is its ongoing presale, where BINO tokens are priced at just $0.02 per token. With a projected listing price of $0.30, early
investors can secure a 15x potential return before the token hits significant exchanges. The presaleâ€™s ongoing phase 1 is on the verge of selling
out and investors will need to pay more for BINO tokens in the next presale phase. Learn more about BinoFi: - Website: https://binofi.com -

- Bitcoin ETFs saw a $165M inflow, marking five straight days of gains. - The Fedâ€™s decision to hold rates triggered a 1,300% surge in ETF
inflows. - Analysts remain split on Bitcoinâ€™s short-term trend amid key resistance levels. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a return of
inflows, posting $165 million on Thursday according to SoSoValue data. This is the fifth day in a row that ETFs have seen inflows, marking
increased institutional demand after weeks of outflows. Institutional Interest Surges Following a loss of more than $6 billion in outflows, Bitcoin
ETFs are now experiencing a turnaround. BlackRockâ€™s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) topped with $172 million in new investments.
Followed by Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) with $9.19 million and $5.22 million,
respectively. Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), however, experienced $17.4 million in outflows, and Grayscaleâ€™s GBTC lost almost $8 million.
Fedâ€™s Interest Rate One of the key factors behind this revival was the Federal Reserveâ€™s choice to keep interest rates unchanged. On
March 20, spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a 1,300% increase in inflows, amounting to almost $166 million. Bitcoin ETFs accumulated almost
$700 million in five days. The Fed, which suggested rate cuts in the future, spurred risk-on assetsâ€™ optimism. Bitcoin momentarily jumped
4.5% to $87,431 before falling back. Ethereum and Solana also gained, while the overall crypto market cap rose to $2.947 trillion. Even with
bullish ETF inflows, analysts are split on the short-term direction of Bitcoin. Technical analysis places Bitcoin at crucial resistance, challenging a
falling trendline and the 100-day moving average. Analystâ€™s view Crypto analyst RJT_WAGMI indicated a potential breakout might spark a
rally, while rejection can induce a dip. Trader Great Mattsby mentioned that Bitcoin is still in a long-term trend channel, and the next major high is
due in 2025-26. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju cautioned that although ETF demand is high, on-chain metrics indicate slowing bull cycle, with
Bitcoin potentially taking 6-12 months to cross its all-time high. Inflows for Bitcoin ETFs indicate renewed institutional optimism, spurred by the
Fedâ€™s move and clarity in regulation. Nevertheless, macroeconomic forces and technical resistance will dictate the path of Bitcoin, with both
short-term volatility and long-term appreciation.

- North Carolinaâ€™s Bitcoin Reserve Act (SB327) allows up to 10% of public funds to be invested in Bitcoin. - The state treasurer will oversee
the funds, secured with multi-signature cold storage. North Carolina is considering a groundbreaking bill that would allow the state to allocate
public funds to Bitcoin. The Bitcoin Reserve and Investment Act (SB327) proposes investing up to 10% of the stateâ€™s general fund in the
digital asset. With North Carolinaâ€™s general fund currently holding $9.5 billion, this move could reshape state financial strategies. The bill, led
by Republican Senators Todd Johnson and Brad Overcash, seeks to establish a secure Bitcoin reserve. To ensure transparency and security, the
funds will be held in multi-signature cold storage. The bill also mandates monthly audits to verify the Bitcoin holdings, ensuring accountability. A key
provision in the bill restricts Bitcoin sales to cases of severe financial crisis. Even in such situations, strict conditions must be met before any
liquidation occurs. This safeguard aims to maintain Bitcoin as a long-term asset rather than a short-term investment. NCâ€™s Bitcoin Bill Could
Set a Precedent The proposal aligns with a growing trend of government interest in digital assets. With two Bitcoin reserve bills currently under
consideration in North Carolinaâ€™s House and Senate, the state could become a leader in crypto adoption for public finance. If passed, this
legislation might encourage other states to follow suit. Despite its potential benefits, Bitcoinâ€™s volatility and regulatory uncertainties pose risks.
However, supporters argue that diversifying reserves with digital assets could offer a hedge against traditional financial market fluctuations. The bill
seeks to balance investment opportunities with strict oversight, ensuring responsible Bitcoin management. As more governments explore digital
asset adoption, North Carolinaâ€™s decision could serve as a model for other states. The success of SB327 will depend on regulatory approval,
financial impact, and long-term crypto market stability. Highlighted Crypto News Today Is Maker (MKR) Ready for Lift-Off, with Eyes Set on
the $1.5K Resistance?
Bitcoin, the worldâ€™s first and largest cryptocurrency, is once again capturing headlines as it holds at $83,925. With institutional players ramping
up their exposure to the asset, Bitcoinâ€™s trajectory continues to maintain a steady upward climb. Recent data highlights the enthusiasm of hedge
funds, corporations, and even sovereign wealth funds, who are growing their holdings as part of long-term investment strategies. Ethereum: A Stout
Force in DeFi, But with Stagnant Growth On the other hand, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is priced at
$1,900. Known for its pioneering role in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and NFTs, Ethereum remains a juggernaut in the
blockchain space. However, itâ€™s fair to say Ethereumâ€™s price movements have been less inspiring lately. Despite leading innovations and
commanding dominance within the DeFi and NFT ecosystems, Ethereum has struggled to break out of its recent price consolidation zone. Still,
Ethereumâ€™s enduring utility and growing network adoption make it a mainstay in most portfolios. Its role as the backbone of decentralized
finance ensures that Ethereum will remain relevant even as the broader market seeks greener pastures. Enter BinoFi (BINO): A Revolutionary
DeFi Solution While Bitcoin and Ethereum anchor the crypto narrative, newer projects are emerging that aim to revolutionize how the industry
operates. BinoFi (BINO) is quickly becoming one of the most intriguing names in decentralized finance. With a clear focus on solving real-world
inefficiencies in trading, security, and cross-chain connectivity, BinoFi is positioning itself as a category leader in DeFi innovation. A Trailblazing
Approach to Financial Systems BinoFiâ€™s most unique offering lies in its hybrid exchange model, which blends the liquidity and speed of
centralized exchanges (CEX) with the transparency and control of decentralized exchanges (DEX). This hybrid approach gives users a smooth
trading experience, free from the limitations of traditional platforms. Adding to its appeal, BinoFi introduces true cross-chain trading without
bridges. By eliminating the risks of legacy bridging systems, which are prone to exploits, BinoFi enables direct swaps across major ecosystems like
Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and Polygon. This innovation drastically reduces friction for traders and developers navigating different
blockchain environments. Additionally, the inclusion of AI-driven trading tools elevates the user experience. These tools offer features like
predictive analytics, portfolio optimization, and automated trading strategies, catering to both beginner and professional traders looking to gain a
competitive edge. Understanding the importance of security in crypto transactions, BinoFi incorporates non-custodial MPC (multi-party
computation) wallets. These advanced wallets remove the need for traditional seed phrases and add layers of cryptographic safety. With gas-free
transactions and user-friendly recovery options, BinoFi ensures a seamless yet secure experience for all users. $BINO Presale Sparks Excitement
At the heart of BinoFiâ€™s ecosystem is its native token, $BINO, which powers the platformâ€™s various functionalities. The ongoing presale
has seen tremendous momentum, with 45% of the first phase allocation sold, amounting to approximately 20 million tokens. The success of the
presale reflects mounting investor confidence in BinoFiâ€™s roadmap and market potential. Priced at $0.02 per token during this first phase,
$BINO offers significant upside as analysts project a potential listing price of $0.30 per token. This represents a staggering 1,400% return for early
adopters, making the presale a focal point for both retail and institutional investors alike. The funds raised from the presale are earmarked for
accelerating platform development, expanding partnerships, and scaling community engagement efforts. From governance voting to trading
rewards, $BINO holders stand to gain a wide array of benefits as BinoFiâ€™s ecosystem grows. Why BinoFi Could Be a Game-Changer The
rise of BinoFi reflects the growing demand for platforms that deliver both innovation and accessibility. By addressing the critical pain points of
traditional DeFi, such as liquidity limitations, high security risks, and lack of interoperability, BinoFi is carving out a distinct niche in the market. Its
roadmap, which includes added staking features, yield optimization tools, and integration with major DeFi protocols, further cements its potential
as a visionary project. By prioritizing user-centric solutions and offering real-world value, BinoFi is prepared to challenge longstanding incumbents
in the space. Final Thoughts Bitcoin may remain the king of cryptocurrencies, and Ethereum the face of DeFi. However, the spotlight is increasingly
shifting to next-generation platforms like BinoFi, which aim to redefine what decentralized finance can offer. With its hybrid infrastructure, cross-
chain capabilities, advanced security and trading tools, BinoFi is positioning itself as a serious contender in the race to become the next big thing in
crypto. For those looking to capitalize on the future of DeFi, BinoFi represents not just an investment, but a vote of confidence in innovation itself.

Did you ever know that meme coins have taken the crypto world by storm, creating wealth overnight for early investors? But which project stands
out? While AI Companions and Dog Bitcoin are making headlines, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is emerging as the hottest contender. With a
revolutionary presale model, a strategic burn mechanism, and an innovative approach, this project is attracting massive interest. This article will
cover the developments and updates of Arctic Pablo Coin, AI Companions, and Dog Bitcoin, exploring why these are the Top New Meme Coins
to Invest in March 2025. Arctic Pablo Coinâ€™s Deflationary Strategy: How Token Burns Boost Value Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is unlike any
other meme coin. Built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), it integrates a unique deflationary mechanism where unsold tokens are permanently
eliminated weekly during the presale. Hence it is one of the top new meme coins to invest in March 2025. The remaining supply after presale
completion will also be burned, ensuring scarcity and long-term sustainability. Token burns not only reduce supply but also increase demand. As
the available APC tokens decrease, each coin becomes more valuable, rewarding early adopters. This scarcity-driven model positions Arctic
Pablo Coin as a prime investment in the meme coin space. Presale: Arctic Pablo Coinâ€™s Journey Hits Nippy Nook! The Arctic Pablo meme
Coin presale follows an unconventional route inspired by the characterâ€™s journey through various locations. Currently, the presale is at Nippy
Nook, the 15th phase, where the token price sits at $0.000079. With over $1.93 million raised, the excitement is at an all-time high. Investors at
this stage have a potential ROI of 10,027.85%, as the launch price is set at $0.008. As Arctic Pablo Coin progresses through its journey, prices
will rise, making this the perfect time to secure tokens at a low entry point. Donâ€™t waitâ€”once Nippy Nook concludes, prices will increase
again. AI Companions Surges with Major Development AI Companions, a cutting-edge meme coin that merges artificial intelligence with
blockchain, recently announced a groundbreaking update: a decentralized AI-driven trading bot. This innovative feature aims to revolutionize
automated trading, giving users access to real-time AI predictions. With its increasing utility and an expanding user base, AI Companions is carving
out a unique niche in the crypto space. Dog Bitcoin Gains Momentum Amid Market Volatility Dog Bitcoin, a meme coin inspired by the success of
Dogecoin and Bitcoin, has been experiencing significant volatility. Recently, the project announced a new mining rewards system, which is
expected to boost its adoption. With increasing attention from investors and growing community support, Dog Bitcoin remains a strong contender
in the meme coin market. Final Thoughts: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Pack With Arctic Pablo Coinâ€™s deflationary mechanism, exciting
presale structure, and staking rewards, it stands out as one of the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in March 2025. AI Companions and Dog
Bitcoin also bring innovative features to the table, but Arctic Pablo Coinâ€™s unique approach is drawing the most attention. As the presale
reaches its final stages, the opportunity to invest at this price point is slipping away. Get in before the next phase kicks in and the price jumps! For

- Metaplanet recently purchased another 150 BTC for $12.5M, bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to 3,200 BTC, and also targets 10,000 BTC by
year-end. - The Japanese company issued Â¥2 billion ($13M) in zero-coupon bonds to fund further Bitcoin acquisitions, following
MicroStrategyâ€™s steps. Metaplanet Inc. is now going bullish on Bitcoin. The Japanese company recently acquired another 150 BTC worth
$12.5 million at an average price of $83,508. This latest purchase totaled its Bitcoin holdings to 3,200 BTC. The company aims to reach 10,000
BTC by year-end. Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich emphasized the firmâ€™s commitment to expanding its Bitcoin reserves despite market
turbulence. Metaplanet has acquired 150 BTC for ~$12.5 million at ~$83,508 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 60.8% YTD 2025. As
of 3/18/2025, we hold 3200 $BTC acquired for ~$266.2 million at ~$83,188 per bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/UMmVan28Xe â€” Simon Gerovich
(@gerovich) March 18, 2025 The strategic purchases follow a similar move by institutional players like MicroStrategy (now Strategy), which
recently acquired 130 BTC, bringing its total to 499,226 BTCâ€”representing 2% of Bitcoinâ€™s total supply. As institutional investors adopt
Bitcoin as a treasury asset, Metaplanetâ€™s long-term vision mirrors broader trends in corporate crypto adoption. Debt Financing and
Institutional Strategy Drive Bitcoin Expansion Metaplanet is financing its Bitcoin accumulation through strategic debt offerings. The company issued
Â¥2 billion ($13M) in zero-coupon bonds to Evo Fund, aiming to implement MicroStrategy Bitcoin purchase history. *Metaplanet Issues 2 Billion
JPY in 0% Ordinary Bonds to Purchase Additional $BTC* pic.twitter.com/RhXoSZD3bw â€” Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) March 18,
2025 These bonds allow Metaplanet to secure funds without immediate interest payments, enabling it to maximize Bitcoin purchases while
leveraging market corrections. Metaplanet has already secured over 50,000 shareholders, including strong endorsements from Strategy. The
companyâ€™s aggressive stance signals its belief in Bitcoinâ€™s long-term potential despite short-term volatility. MicroStrategyâ€™s influence
on Metaplanet is evident, with both firms leveraging debt to expand holdings. MicroStrategyâ€™s past acquisitions at Bitcoinâ€™s all-time highs
resulted in unrealized losses, yet the firm remains committed to its Bitcoin-first approach. Metaplanet, learning from this, appears to be timing its
acquisitions more strategically. Market Reactions and the Bigger Institutional Crypto Play The crypto market remains in a state of correction, with
Bitcoin ETFs seeing outflows of $5 billion in recent weeks. Despite this, institutional demand for Bitcoin continues to grow. According to
bitcointreasuries.net, over 170 entities now hold more than 3.1 million BTC. Market analysts are divided on Bitcoinâ€™s next move. While some
argue the correction could deepen, others believe the Fear and Greed Indexâ€”now in â€œfearâ€​ territoryâ€”suggests a potential rebound.
Historically, such conditions have preceded major price surges. For Metaplanet, these price fluctuations present buying opportunities. Its recent
acquisition, alongside its strategic funding approach, positions it as one of the most aggressive corporate Bitcoin adopters. With its holdings nearing
$1 billion in value, the company is emerging as a major player in the institutional Bitcoin landscape. Highlighted Crypto News for Today Santiment

- CryptoQuant CEO Young Ju, stated that Bitcoin might be showing bearish prices for the next 6-12 months. - Bitcoinâ€™s recent trading activity
suggests the cryptocurrency entering a consolidation phase. The crypto market has been seemingly entering a consolidation phase over the past
few days. The lack of significant action has caused FUD among investors, which has, in turn, initiated a selling spree among short-term traders.
Meanwhile, the ETF sector and crypto reserves still show increased activity despite the price slack. Notably, to confirm investorsâ€™ worst fears,
CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju posted a Bitcoin prediction a few hours ago. According to the prediction, Ju states that Bitcoinâ€™s bull cycle is
officially over. He further noted that for the next 6 to 12 months, we can expect bearish or sidewise prices. The community has given much
attention to this speculation, discussing it fervently. The CryptoQuant CEO has applied a PCA-risk indicator to on-chain metrics such as MVRV
and SOPR. Using this he calculated a 365-day moving average and by identifying inflection points confirmed his analysis. Furthermore, Ki Young
Ju also said that with fresh liquidity drying up, new whales are selling their Bitcoin for lower prices. This further acts as a catalyst for bearish trends
in the cryptocurrency. BTC is currently trading at the consolidated price of $83,000. Will Bitcoinâ€™s $80K Consolidation Persist For Longer?
Over the past week, Bitcoin has been trading in the $80K â€“ $85K range. It has attempted several times to break the $86,000 resistance but
failed to do so. In the last 24 hours, the cryptocurrency has factored in an additional price drop of 0.21%. This caused Bitcoin to trade at the
border of $82K-$83K levels, after struggling to hold the $83K support. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at 82,991 as per CMC data.
Zooming out, into its weekly chart, the digital asset recorded trading at $80,354 in the weekâ€™s beginning. These inferences further confirm the
cryptocurrencyâ€™s consolidation. Combining this with the CryptoQuant CEOâ€™s prediction, Bitcoin might face extended periods of trading at
this current price range. Meanwhile, other altcoins such as Solana and Cardano have also shown struggles in breaking resistance.
Bitcoin Cash (BCH) made headlines when it reached a record number of transactions, which shows that it works well as a payment option that
can grow and perform efficiently. Yet BCH sets a record in transaction numbers while FXGuys draws more investor interest because of strong
presale progress. FXGuys now takes over $4 million at its Stage 3 presale; its $FXG token sells for $0.05. Bitcoin Cash builds on fast payment
handling, but FXGuys builds a platform for traders that gives clear financial rewards beyond standard payments. As Bitcoin Cash adds more
activity to its network, FXGuys marks itself as the next key DeFi choice, attracting traders and investors who want high-yield returns rather than
mere blockchain speed. FXGuys Is More Than Just a Tokenâ€”Itâ€™s a Traderâ€™s Financial Engine Bitcoin Cashâ€™s growth is strong, but
buyers want more than many transactions. BCH works well for payments, while FXGuys offers a full trading system that pays users for market
work. The FXGuys system has a prop trading funding plan that gives traders up to $500,000 in capital. This element explains why smart prop
traders switch from just holding to trading actively with FXGuys. Investors may also stake $FXG tokens to earn a 20 % profit plus a share of
broker trading volume. This staking plan allows investors to gain from ongoing market activity, building a financial setup that provides steady
income; Bitcoin Cash does not. FXGuys Offers True Financial Freedom with No KYC and No Fees One of the biggest challenges in
cryptocurrencies today is the increasing control of exchanges and regulatory obstacles. While Bitcoin Cash remains an effective payment solution,
users must rely on centralized platforms to trade. These platforms require identity verification and impose withdrawal limits. FXGuys removes these
obstacles by offering a decentralized trading experience without identity verification. Unlike Bitcoin Cash, which depends on merchant adoption or
exchange listings, FXGuys users can trade without any restrictions, ensuring greater access. Additionally, FXGuys does not impose any buy or sell
taxes, making it a highly cost-effective trading platform. Traders and investors can withdraw fiat and cryptocurrencies instantly in over 100 local
currencies, giving FXGuys an edge over services that delay withdrawals or impose unnecessary fees. The FXGuys ecosystem supports various
trading platforms, including MT5, Match-Trader, cTrader, and DXtrade, ensuring that users have the necessary tools for success. Trade2Earn
Model Creates a Self-Sustaining Demand for FXGuys One of FXGuysâ€™ biggest assets compared to Bitcoin Cash is its Trade2Earn model,
which compensates users for each trade. For every trade made on FXGuys, users get extra $FXG tokens, which builds token demand while
paying active traders. Bitcoin Cash may handle transactions well but does not give clear financial rewards to holders or traders. FXGuys, however,
builds a lasting financial system that helps its users beyond basic payments. FXGuysâ€™ $4M Presale Shows Where the Market Is Headed With
over $4 million raised plus a presale cost set at $0.05, FXGuys shows investors leave behind traditional blockchain assets like Bitcoin Cash for
projects that let them earn money directly. Bitcoin Cash works well as a system for transactions; FXGuys offers a setup where traders add to their
wealth through staking, prop trading, Trade2Earn rewards. More investors switch to options that give clear money benefits; FXGuys is the top
option for traders or investors. The only question remains: Do you choose fast transactions or try a setup that helps you build wealth? FXGuys
prepares for a wide uptake; investors clearly choose money growth over blockchain excitement. To find out more about FXGuys follow the links

- A dormant whale booked an $85M profit, and miners cashed out $27M, increasing selling pressure on Bitcoin. - U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have
recorded five consecutive weeks of outflows, raising concerns over institutional support. - While BTC shows signs of recovery, a post-retest
reversal could push the price down to the $75,533 Fibonacci level. Fluctuating near $83,000, Bitcoin is at a decisive moment. Following a 2.12%
pullback on Sunday, BTC posted a minor 0.83% gain to start the week. However, this recovery could be a retest of a broken trendline, which
may lead to a potential price reversal toward $75,000. Dormant Whale Cashes Out $85M in Bitcoin As Bitcoin hangs in uncertainty, a long-
dormant whale has moved to book massive profits. According to SpotOnChain, the entity deposited 300 BTC worth $25.1 million on FalconX
after holding the asset for nearly 1.5 years. The whale had originally purchased 1,500 BTC from Cumberland on August 18, 2023, at an average
cost of $26,353, totaling $39.5 million. Now, with BTC near $83K, the whale has strategically shifted holdings, transferring 1,050 BTC worth
$87.2 million to two new wallets while leaving 150 BTC worth $12.5 million in the original address. In addition to the whaleâ€™s profit-taking,
Bitcoin miners have also ramped up their selling activity. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that BTC miners have collectively cashed out over
$27 million this month, as shown by CryptoQuant data. The surge in miner profit realization indicates increased selling pressure, which could
contribute to a potential BTC price downturn. Adding to Bitcoinâ€™s challenges, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded five consecutive weeks
of outflows. In February alone, these funds saw a $3.56 billion outflow, and March has already witnessed an additional $1.67 billion in
withdrawals. Since February 6, only four days have recorded inflows, raising concerns about declining institutional interest. With ETF outflows
rising, the risk of another negative weekly performance increases. This trend could further weigh on Bitcoinâ€™s price, reinforcing the bearish
outlook. On the daily chart, BTC has shown a lower price rejection, sustaining its recovery above the 61.80% Fibonacci level at $81,855. The
Bollinger Bands indicate a rebound from the lower band to the 20-day SMA, suggesting a potential bullish move. Meanwhile, the MACDâ€™s
positive crossover signals possible upward momentum. However, the recovery may be short-lived. Analysts warn that the current uptrend could
be a post-retest reversal, meaning BTC could drop toward the 50% Fibonacci level at $75,533 if sellers gain control. On the bullish front, Ali
Martinez suggests that BTC is forming an ascending triangle pattern, which could drive an 8% price surge. If this pattern plays out, BTC could
climb to the 78.60% Fibonacci level near $91,780.
- A Bitcoin whale opened a $450M short position on Hyperliquid with 40x leverage. - The whale deposited $5M in USDC to strengthen its
position and avoid liquidation. A Bitcoin whale on Hyperliquid is facing a coordinated effort to force liquidation after opening a $450 million short
position with 40x leverage. The traderâ€™s aggressive move has drawn widespread attention from the crypto community, triggering a
â€œmanhuntâ€​ led by traders aiming to counteract the position. The trader first opened the massive short position on March 16, initially valued at
over $300 million. By March 17, the position had grown to 5,167 BTC, worth around $429 million. The whale closed two positions through
Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) for a total of 208 BTC, valued at over $18 million. At 4:30 AM UTC, the whale deposited $7.5 million in
collateral to avoid liquidation. On-chain data shows an unrealized loss of $1.1 million in profit and loss (PNL). However, the traderâ€™s short
position remains active, with an unrealized profit of $4 million. Coordinated Efforts to Liquidate the Whale Crypto trader @Cbb0fe, also known as
CBB, identified the whaleâ€™s short position and called for a coordinated effort to liquidate it. CBB urged traders to message them if they were
willing to participate, requiring a minimum â€œ7-figureâ€​ commitment. As a result, the whale was forced to deposit $5 million in USDC to maintain
margin requirements. However, the effort failed as the whale reinforced its position by continuing to short BTC through TWAP orders. Hyperliquid
acknowledged the viral short trade, highlighting its platformâ€™s role in hosting high-stakes market activity. â€œWhen a whale shorts $450M+
BTC and wants a public audience, itâ€™s only possible on Hyperliquid,â€​ the platform stated. The incident is not the traderâ€™s first
controversial move. Earlier this month, they opened a 50x leveraged Ethereum position worth $340 million, leading to a $4 million loss for
Hyperliquid. The platform later adjusted its risk management strategies to mitigate future risks. Highlighted Crypto News Today BSC Surpasses

- North Korean Lazarus group holds more Bitcoins than El Salvador and Bhutan. - Lazarus group converted all the stolen Ethereum in Bybit hack
into Bitcoins. The Democratic Peopleâ€™s Republic of Korea (DPRK) has become popular for crypto hacks. Chainalysis report also highlighted
that most of the hacks have DPRK behind them. The recent Bybit hack is also linked to DPRKâ€™s Lazarus group. It is now making headlines,
holding more Bitcoins than El Salvador and Bhutan. As per the Arkham Intelligence platform, Lazarus Groupâ€™s portfolio is worth
$1,159,960,333.48 at present. It holds 13,518 Bitcoins, 13,702 Ether, 5,022 BNB tokens, and other stablecoins. Bitcoins amount to a major
share of its portfolio, being worth $1.13 billion. Lazarus Group surpassed El Salvador and Bhutan in terms of BTC holdings. While El Salvador
holds 6,118 BTC, Bhutan holds 10,635 Bitcoins. El Salvador continued to buy Bitcoins ever since it announced Bitcoin as a legal tender in the
country. On the other hand, Bhutan accumulated most of its holdings through domestic Bitcoin mining over the past few years. Lazarus Group of
North Korea Converted Ethereum from Bybit Hack to Bitcoin Lazarus group stole around $1.4 billion worth of Ethereum from the Bybit hack and
sent shockwaves through the industry. It steadily laundered funds through multiple wallet addresses. The hacker group converted a major portion
of the stolen Ethereum to Bitcoin using THORChain. Even though Bybit CEO Ben Zhou has been making efforts to trace the stolen funds, they
didnâ€™t seem to have any effect. He created the Lazarusbounty.com website which shares updates regarding the stolen funds. In one of his X
posts, Ben Zhou shared that 77% of the stolen funds are still traceable. On the other hand, the hacker group in North Korea laundered total funds
and even converted them into Bitcoins. Meanwhile, the OKX crypto exchange suspended its DEX services temporarily to improve security
because the hacker group used its services to move funds. Highlighted Crypto News Today:
Originally published in 2014 and under $21 until 2017, Ethereum trades at $2,400 and has an all-time high of $4,891. Likewise, Bitcoin
appreciated from just pennies to its current all-time high of $109,114, which was useless at its original mining in 2009. These amazing increases
made early adopters millionaires, confirming that cryptocurrencies are unusual but transforming investment opportunities. Rexas Finance (RXS), a
self-made crypto millionaire, has found another altcoin ready to emulate ETH and BTC. With its creative approach to real-world asset (RWA)
tokenization destined to alter the financial scene, this new Bitcoin is being praised as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Rexas Finance (RXS): The
New Once-In-A-Lifetime Altcoin in the Crypto Market Blockchain technology marks a new age, represented by Rexas Finance (RXS). Designed
to democratize and simplify access to tokenized real-world assets, Rexas Finance enables people and organizations to easily produce, exchange,
and oversee digital versions of tangible objects. These include real estate, art, intellectual property, and commodities, all of which RXS easily and
transparently facilitates worldwide tokenization. Rexas Finance is a special investment because of its accessibility and creativity. Unlike most
conventional cryptocurrencies, which only consider digital value exchange, RXS closes the gap between physical and digital assets, generating
almost endless possibilities for investors. Its solid foundations and fast-expanding community help define it as the next major cryptocurrency
breakthrough. Rexas Finance (RXS) Presale: A Record-Breaking Performance Rexas Financeâ€™s (RXS) presale performance shows its
strength since it surpasses market expectations. Pricing at $0.20, RXS is in its 12th and last presale round after having raised over $46.76 million
thus far. The tremendous investor demand indicates a strong conviction in its long-term potential even if 90.76% of its $56 million presale target is
already filled. The Rexas Finance team has chosen a public presale instead of many initiatives seeking venture capital money so that regular
investors may join this innovative movement. Officially set at $0.25, the token should be shown on June 19, 2025. Given that RXS is already
slated to be listed on three top ten tier-1 exchanges, this listing will be noteworthy. Due to community support and significant exchange backing,
RXS is expected to soar after its official launch. The Certik audit of Rexas Finance is among the most important elements influencing confidence.
Since security is a major issue in the crypto market, a Certik-certified audit gives investors trust and guarantees project validity. Following its
listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, RXS has also become popular, increasing investor confidence and supporting the fast presale
expansion. Can Rexas Finance (RXS) Replicate the Success of Bitcoin and Ethereum? Bitcoin and Ethereum are legendary because they offer
huge rewards over time. Bitcoin climbed from fractions of a cent to over $109,000, and Ethereum jumped from under a dollar to almost $5,000.
With a faster development path, crypto analysts and self-made millionaires are now recognizing similar promises in Rexas Finance (RXS). RXS is
positioned to explode greatly, given the rising acceptance of RWA tokenization and the great market demand for creative blockchain solutions.
Reflecting the explosive rise of ETH and BTC but in a shorter period, some analysts estimate its price could soar by over 700,000% in the next
years. The growing interest in real-world asset tokenization, a market expected to reach trillions of dollars in value, explains this expected
exponential rise. The Best Time to Get Involved in Rexas Finance (RXS) According to history, early identification of highly promising ideas yields
the largest increases in cryptocurrency. Those who bought Bitcoin or Ethereum early on had transforming returns. Now Rexas Finance (RXS)
offers a similar prospect; with its presale almost finished, this could be the last chance to get in before a significant price increase. With a launch
date of June 19, 2025, and verified listings on elite exchanges, RXS is primed for explosive expansion. As the project gathers momentum, its value
surpassing expectations via popular adoption could be one of the most fulfilling investments of this decade. Many times, crypto billionaires are
people who see and seize possibilities before the general public. One such unusual investment that promises unmatched development in the
changing digital economy is Rexas Finance (RXS). For more information about Rexas Finance (RXS) visit the links below: - Website:

- The Bank of Korea now officially dismissed Bitcoin as a foreign exchange reserve due to inherent risk and volatile nature. - The decision was
made amid growing global interest in national Bitcoin reserves, led by the U.S. and other countries. The Bank of Korea (BOK) has officially
rejected the idea of considering Bitcoin (BTC) in its foreign exchange reserves, mainly because of its volatile nature and liquidity concerns. In a
response to an inquiry from lawmaker Cha Gyu-geum, the central bank stated, the central bank has confirmed that it had neither reviewed nor
considered Bitcoin for reserves. This was revealed by a KoreanHerald, a reputable Korean media company. â€œBitcoinâ€™s price volatility is
very high,â€​ the BOK emphasized, and also believe transaction cost will rise during market downturn. The central bank also made references to
International Monetary Fund (IMF) guidelines, which requires any reserve asset to possesses massive liquidity, stability and credit ratings, which
Bitcoin currency lacks. Despite increasing global discussions on digital assets in national reserves, South Korea remains cautious. The stance
contrasts with the United States, where President Donald Trump recently announced a strategic Bitcoin stockpile, fueling debates on its role in
global finance. Political Pressure Grows, But Central Bank Stays Resistant The rejection comes amid rising political interest in crypto integration.
Some lawmakers, especially from South Koreaâ€™s Democratic Party, have pushed for a national Bitcoin reserve. Crypto lobbyists have also
urged the country to explore stablecoin-backed reserves to modernize its financial strategy. However, the BOK has remained firm, stressing that
foreign exchange reserves must be immediately usable. â€œReserves should be available for immediate use whenever needed,â€​ the bank stated,
dismissing Bitcoinâ€™s role as a reliable asset. Prof. Yang Jun-seok of Catholic University of Korea echoed this sentiment, arguing that reserves
should be proportional to trade currencies. â€œUnless major economies issue bonds in Bitcoin, its advantage as a reserve asset is limited,â€​ he
explained. While political momentum builds, the BOK is unlikely to shift its stance unless global financial institutions, like the IMF, formally
recognize crypto assets as viable reserves. Global Trends: The Divide on Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset South Koreaâ€™s caution aligns with the
views of other major economies. The European Central Bank, the Swiss National Bank, and the Japanese government have all voiced skepticism
about adding Bitcoin to reserves. Meanwhile, the U.S. has taken a different approach. Trumpâ€™s executive order to stockpile Bitcoin has fueled
speculation that more nations may follow. Brazil and the Czech Republic have also expressed interest in Bitcoin reserves, highlighting the growing
divide in global financial policy. Prof. Kang Tae-soo of KAIST Graduate School of Finance believes stablecoins may be a more viable option.
â€œThe U.S. is likely to leverage stablecoins rather than Bitcoin to maintain dollar hegemony. Whether the IMF will recognize stablecoins as
reserves in the future is important,â€​ he stated. However, South Korea is taking a wait-and-see approach. With Bitcoinâ€™s price currently
fluctuating from $80,000 to $76,000 in just 30 daysâ€”the central bank remains unconvinced of its stability. Highlighted Crypto News for Today
- Bitcoin (BTC) is holding above $82K but faces resistance near $85K. - The market cap stands at $1.63T, with trading volume down 48.64%.
Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $82,667, down 2.11% in the past 24 hours. The market cap has slipped to $1.63 trillion, reflecting a 2.06% decline.
Trading volume has dropped 48.64% to $13.6 billion, bringing the market cap ratio to 0.8292%. Brazil is making strides in digital finance with a
proposal to allow employees to receive salaries in Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs and BlackRock have ramped up their BTC exposure.
These investments highlight Bitcoinâ€™s growing presence in traditional finance, encouraging institutional investors to reconsider crypto allocations
despite macroeconomic uncertainties. Will BTC Regain Its Momentum? Bitcoin faces immediate resistance at $83,151. If bulls push past this level,
BTC could rally toward $85,000, with a potential test of $86,500 if momentum strengthens. On the downside, the nearest support is $82,400. A
break below this level could send Bitcoin toward $80,000, with a deeper correction possible near $78,500. The 14-day RSI stands at 53.90,
indicating neutral momentum. The RSI moving average is 45.34, which is slightly below the current RSI, suggesting a mild upward trend. If the RSI
crosses above 60, bullish momentum could strengthen, pushing BTC toward higher resistance levels. However, if it drops below 45, selling
pressure may increase. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is at 0.01, signaling weak capital inflows. If CMF rises above 0.05, it would confirm
stronger demand from investors. A dip below -0.05 could indicate growing outflows, increasing bearish pressure. The 50-day moving average
(MA) remains below the 200-day MA, forming a bearish crossover. This suggests Bitcoin could struggle to maintain upward momentum unless it
breaks key resistance levels. If Bitcoin holds above $82,400, it may attempt a breakout toward $85Kâ€“$90K in the coming weeks. Highlighted
Crypto News Today Hayden Davis Launches $WOLF Token Amid Interpol Red Notice
What if it were possible to go back in time and buy Bitcoin at its ICO price? That opportunity is long gone, but history often repeats itself in new
ways. In 2009, Bitcoin quietly emerged as a decentralized alternative to traditional finance, offering early participants a rare chance to enter at a
fraction of a cent. Those who recognized its potential saw returns beyond imagination. However, Bitcoinâ€™s early window is closed, and
todayâ€™s entry points are significantly higher. That doesnâ€™t mean the chance for substantial growth in blockchain investments is over.
Qubetics is shaping up to be the next major contender, offering something that early blockchain projects couldnâ€™tâ€” enhanced security, and
real-world usability. Unlike Bitcoin, which functions primarily as a store of value, Qubetics introduces a Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet bringing
practical applications to businesses and individuals alike. For those who missed Bitcoinâ€™s early days, Qubetics presents a new avenue to
engage with blockchain innovation at an early stage. Qubetics: Your Chance at Redemption Qubetics is redefining digital asset management with its
Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, a feature designed to solve one of cryptoâ€™s biggest challengesâ€”seamless interaction between multiple
blockchains. Many users struggle with juggling different wallets for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain, leading to inefficiencies,
security risks, and lost assets. Qubetics simplifies this by allowing users to store, manage, and transact digital assets across multiple networks in a
single, user-friendly interface. Security remains a top priority. Unlike centralized wallets that hold usersâ€™ private keys, Qubeticsâ€™ Non-
Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet ensures that individuals maintain full control over their funds, eliminating third-party vulnerabilities. This technology is
particularly beneficial for businesses and professionals managing cross-chain transactions. This level of innovation positions Qubetics as one of the
best cryptos to buy this month with real-world applications and strong technological foundations. Qubetics is in its 25th crypto presale stage, with
$TICS tokens priced at $0.1074. The presale has gained immense traction, raising over $15 million, attracting more than 23,000 token holders,
with over 499 million $TICS tokens sold. For those looking at potential returns, analysts predict $TICS could reach $0.25 post-presale (133%
ROI). Projections suggest further growth to $1, $5, or even $10 after the mainnet launch, with potential ROIs of 831%, 4,553%, and 9,207%,
respectively. Bitcoin: The Pioneer of Cryptocurrency Bitcoinâ€™s 2009 ICO was unlike anything the financial world had seen. Initially distributed
through mining, Bitcoin offered a new financial paradigmâ€”one that removed intermediaries and gave individuals control over their money. Its early
adopters, who mined or purchased BTC at fractions of a cent, saw exponential gains as Bitcoin surged to all-time highs. Despite its historical
significance, Bitcoin operates primarily as a store of value rather than an ecosystem for real-world applications. The blockchain, though secure,
lacks the flexibility needed for multi-chain interactions and real-world asset integration. While Bitcoin remains the most widely recognized digital
asset, newer projects like Qubetics aim to expand blockchainâ€™s capabilities beyond a financial asset and into a functional, scalable ecosystem.
This is why those seeking the best cryptos to buy this month should look beyond just Bitcoin. Conclusion Bitcoinâ€™s early investors saw massive
returns, but for those who missed out, there is still an opportunity to engage in the next wave of blockchain innovation. Qubetics presents a second
chance to get in early on a project with real-world applications, interoperability, and strong growth potential. Its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet
solves one of the most pressing challenges in crypto today, offering a secure, seamless, and user-friendly solution for cross-chain transactions.
While Bitcoin has established itself as the foundation of cryptocurrency, Qubetics represents the next evolutionâ€”a blockchain project that
integrates usability, security, and scalability. As one of the best cryptos to buy this month, it provides a rare opportunity to participate in an early-
stage project with strong fundamentals. For More Information: - Qubetics: https://qubetics.com - Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ - Telegram:

Bitcoinâ€™s path to $150K; How Lightchain AI and Solana are shaping the future of blockchain. As Bitcoin climbs higher, Lightchain AI and
Solana are emerging as game-changers in the crypto space. Lightchain AI, which raised $17.7 million at a presale price of $0.00712, combines AI
and blockchain to power scalable, efficient decentralized applications. Meanwhile, Solanaâ€™s high-speed transaction capabilities continue to
attract attention. Together, these platforms are redefining possibilities in the crypto world and paving the way for significant growth in 2025 and
beyond. Bitcoinâ€™s Path to $150K- Whatâ€™s Fueling Surge? Bitcoinâ€™s path toward the $150,000 mark is being driven by several key
factors. First, government initiatives have played a significant role. President Donald Trumpâ€™s executive order to establish a government Bitcoin
reserve has boosted confidence in the cryptocurrencyâ€™s future, signaling strong institutional support. Regulatory developments are another
critical factor. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, allowing for greater institutional investment.
This approval has enhanced Bitcoinâ€™s credibility and made it more accessible to a wider range of investors. Market cycles also contribute to
Bitcoinâ€™s price movements. Historically, Bitcoinâ€™s price surges have coincided with its halving events, which reduce the rate of new Bitcoin
creation. These supply constraints often lead to increased demand and higher prices. Lastly, macroeconomic factors play a role. The Federal
Reserveâ€™s anticipated interest rate cuts may increase liquidity in financial markets, encouraging more investment in Bitcoin as investors seek
higher returns. Together, these factors create a supportive environment for Bitcoin, strengthening projections that it could reach or even surpass
$150,000 in the near future. How Lightchain AI and Solana Are Shaping Future of Crypto Lightchain AI and Solana are pioneering advancements
in the cryptocurrency landscape, each contributing uniquely to its evolution. Lightchain AI seamlessly integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain
technology, offering scalable and efficient solutions for decentralized applications. Its innovative approach has attracted significant investor interest,
raising over $17.7 million at a presale price of $0.00712 per token. This substantial funding underscores the marketâ€™s confidence in Lightchain
AIâ€™s potential to deliver real-world applications beyond speculative trading. Solana, on the other hand, has emerged as a formidable
competitor to established blockchains like Ethereum. Renowned for its high transaction throughput and low fees, Solana is now generating more
fees than Ethereum, offering users a faster and more cost-effective service. This efficiency has positioned Solana as a preferred platform for
decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces, thereby expanding the crypto ecosystemâ€™s accessibility and
functionality. Collectively, Lightchain AI and Solana are shaping the future of crypto by addressing scalability, efficiency, and practical application
challenges, paving the way for broader adoption and integration of blockchain technologies. Lightchain AI- Set to Lead Next Crypto Boom!
Lightchain AI is gaining momentum as a leading altcoin in the 2025 crypto market. Unlike speculative tokens, it integrates AI with blockchain to
drive real-world applications, offering a strong use case beyond trading. With a focus on scalability and decentralized AI solutions, Lightchain AI is
positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for AI-driven blockchain utilities. As investor confidence surges, its upcoming mainnet launch could
further solidify its role as a key player in the next crypto boom. Do not miss out on the opportunity to be part of Lightchain AIâ€™s
groundbreaking journey and its potential to shape the future of crypto. - https://lightchain.ai - https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf -

analyst Matthew Hyland warns that Bitcoin must close above $89,000 on the weekly chart to avoid further declines to $69,000. The post-election
hype faded after the White House Crypto Summit on March 7. Despite lower than expected CPI inflation on March 12, Bitcoinâ€™s price
dropped after the report. Crypto ETFs have also suffered. Since February, they have seen four consecutive weeks of outflows, totaling $4.75
billion. Market Signals No Prolonged Bear Trend Bitcoin investment vehicles alone recorded $756 million in outflows this month. Poor sentiment
and recession fears have fueled panic selling. The Total3 Market Cap, which excludes Bitcoin and Ethereum, has plunged 27% since Trumpâ€™s
inauguration, falling from $1.1 trillion to $795 billion. Despite the decline in demand, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju does not see this as a sign of
a prolonged bear market. He argues that demand slowdowns are common in volatile markets. Several on-chain metrics suggest the broader
market is not in panic mode. Long-term investors continue to hold, and institutional interest remains steady. Exchange inflows are low, suggesting
reduced selling pressure. Accumulation addresses are slowing but remain active. Bitcoinâ€™s Average True Range (ATR), which measures

The crypto market is heating up, and some coins are making serious waves. AAVE is making headlines as Ethereum whales accumulate massive
holdings, anticipating a 2,000% price surge. Meanwhile, Stacks (STX) is gaining traction, with its price sitting at $0.6018 and a market cap of
$912.7M, signaling potential growth. But while these projects ride the momentum, a new player is emergingâ€”Qubetics ($TICS). Qubetics
isnâ€™t just another token; itâ€™s a game-changer in Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization, bridging the gap between traditional finance and
Web3. With an active presale, a weekly price increase mechanism, and projections hinting at 9,206.51% ROI, Qubetics is positioning itself as the
next crypto to hit $1. The question is: can it outshine AAVE and Stacks in long-term value and adoption? Letâ€™s dive in. Bridging Web3 &
Real Assets: The Power of Qubetics The problem with most crypto projects? They exist in isolation from the real world. Qubetics is rewriting the
playbook by launching the worldâ€™s first Web3 aggregator, designed to unify leading blockchains while bringing tangible assets into the crypto
space. Imagine a world where real estate, intellectual property, and commodities are tokenized, allowing businesses and individuals to fractionalize
ownership and trade assets efficiently. A small business owner can use Qubetics to tokenize their office space, sell fractional shares, and raise
capital without traditional banking barriers. Meanwhile, an artist could tokenize their intellectual property, selling ownership rights on the blockchain
while retaining creative control. The potential isnâ€™t just theoreticalâ€”itâ€™s transformative. By removing liquidity barriers and democratizing
asset ownership, Qubetics is positioning itself as the next crypto to hit $1, creating real-world utility that AAVE and Stacks lack. Qubetics Presale:
The Next Crypto to Hit $1 with Insane ROI & Weekly Price Surges Qubetics is currently in its 25th presale stage, with $TICS priced at $0.1074.
This presale isnâ€™t just another early-bird opportunityâ€”it follows a 7-day stage system, where prices increase every Sunday at 12 AM by
10%. Over $14.9M has been raised, with 22,900+ token holders and 499M+ tokens sold, proving strong community demand. With its rapid
growth, many believe Qubetics could be the next crypto to hit $1 in the coming months. The ROI potential is where things get wild. If $TICS
reaches just $1, thatâ€™s an 830.65% returnâ€”a level that many presale tokens fail to achieve. But if Qubetics hits $10 or even $15 post-
mainnet launch in Q2 2025, participants could see a 9,206.51% to 13,859.77% ROI. With such numbers, Qubetics isnâ€™t just another
presaleâ€”itâ€™s shaping up to be the best crypto presale for those looking to maximize returns. For example, a $100 investment today at
$0.1074 gets you 930 $TICS. If the price hits $1, thatâ€™s $930. At $10, thatâ€™s $9,300, and at $15, it skyrockets to $13,950. Few cryptos
offer this kind of asymmetric return potential, which is why the Qubetics presale continues to attract early adopters looking for the next crypto to
hit $1. AAVEâ€™s 2,000% Prediction: Why Ethereum Whales Are Loading Up AAVE is making headlines after a huge accumulation by
Ethereum whales, leading analysts to predict a possible 2,000% surge. With DeFi expanding, AAVEâ€™s lending and borrowing ecosystem is
seeing renewed adoption. Analysts suggest this could send AAVEâ€™s price soaring as liquidity pools grow, and the platform strengthens its
dominance in the decentralized finance space. The key driver behind this potential rally is the rise in Ethereum Layer-2 adoption, which directly
benefits AAVE. As Ethereumâ€™s ecosystem expands, AAVEâ€™s role in DeFi lending becomes even more critical. With whale movements
aligning with bullish sentiment, AAVE is a strong contender in the next market cycle. Stacks (STX): Price Momentum & On-Chain Growth Stacks
(STX) is currently trading at $0.6018, showing a 0.87% increase in 24 hours, with a market cap of $912.7M. While the price remains volatile, the
total circulating supply of 1.51B STX suggests room for growth. One of Stacksâ€™ key strengths is its focus on Bitcoin smart contracts, offering
a unique way to interact with the Bitcoin blockchain. This has contributed to its steady adoption, but volume has dropped 34.41% in the past 24
hours, raising concerns about near-term liquidity. The big question: can Stacks break past the $1 mark? While it has strong fundamentals, it faces
stiff competition from projects with higher liquidity, broader adoption, and unique tokenomicsâ€”a space where Qubetics seems to have an upper
hand. Which Crypto Has the Best Upside? AAVE has strong backing from Ethereum whales, and Stacks is leveraging Bitcoinâ€™s security for
smart contracts. But when it comes to real-world use cases, accessibility, and presale potential, Qubetics stands out. With a weekly price increase
mechanism, real-world asset tokenization, and a massive ROI potential, itâ€™s no surprise that Qubetics is being called the next crypto to hit $1.
If youâ€™re looking for a high-upside opportunity, it might be time to join this crypto presale before the next price jump. For More Information: -

Qubetics the next crypto to hit $1? Qubeticsâ€™ real-world asset tokenization and unique presale model make it a strong candidate to reach $1,
especially with its 830.65% ROI potential. 2. How does Qubetics compare to AAVE and Stacks? While AAVE benefits from Ethereumâ€™s
DeFi expansion and Stacks integrates with Bitcoin, Qubetics offers real-world asset tokenization, a game-changer in crypto adoption. 3. When
does the Qubetics presale end? Qubeticsâ€™ presale follows a 7-day stage system, with prices increasing every Sunday at 12 AM until the

- Bitcoin dominance surged to 62% today. - Crypto trading volume declined 15% and market cap surged only 1.77% in the last 24 hours. The
crypto market shows slight recovery today as the Bitcoin price increased by around 2%. From the lows of $76K yesterday, Bitcoin price surged
past the $80K and is currently trading in the $83K range. The overall crypto market cap increased by 1.77% and its value is hovering at $2.71
trillion. As per the chart, Bitcoin dominance surged to 62% today. When the crypto market was on a short bull run, Bitcoin dominance dropped to
a year-low of 55%. That time, Bitcoin reached an all-time high and several altcoins recorded significant price surges. However, the crypto market
is weak at present and altcoins are struggling to keep up with their slight price surges. The overall crypto market trading volume declined by a
significant 15% in the last 24 hours. Its value used to record around $420 billion during peak market times. However, the daily trading volume is
only $101.28 billion at present. This reflects trader exhaustion and weakening market momentum, which could bring more losses. Whatâ€™s
Ahead for Bitcoin in the Coming Weeks? The global macroeconomic concerns are influencing the crypto market at present. Increasing trade
tensions as a result of Trumpâ€™s new tariffs and recession fears are making traders cautious of risky investments. Despite the Trump
administration moving forward crypto regulation and Bitcoin reserve creation, the industry doesnâ€™t seem to be bullish. Meanwhile the crypto
fear and greed index records â€œ21â€​, indicating fear sentiment across the market. If this continues, we might see further downturn of the crypto
market in the coming weeks. In the absence of a significant catalyst that could push the crypto market, BTC price would fall again to the $70K
price range. Highlighted Crypto News Today:
Cryptocurrency is no longer a niche investment choice, but an increasingly mainstream opportunity. The journey for many starts with learning about
the best cryptos for beginners, and this article will delve into three noteworthy cryptocurrencies: Qubetics, Sonic (formerly Fantom), and Bitcoin
Cash. Each of these projects offers unique value propositions for backers, participants, and early adopters looking for exciting, secure, and
scalable options in the blockchain space. While Bitcoin Cash has seen steady support among digital finance enthusiasts, Sonicâ€™s rebranding
from Fantom represents a significant evolution, and Qubetics is making waves with its promising presale figures. This article will take a closer look
at why these three cryptos are gaining traction among new and experienced community members alike, offering an insightful view into their current
standing in the market. At the forefront of innovation, Qubetics addresses challenges that have plagued blockchain systems, focusing on real-world
applications and delivering solutions where previous projects have fallen short. The Qubetics presale has already raised substantial funds and has
become a hot topic among early adopters, signaling its potential for long-term success. Qubetics: A New Era in Blockchain and Digital Finance
Qubetics ($TICS) is a blockchain project that is revolutionizing the way cross-border transactions are handled. It aims to simplify and streamline
financial transactions for businesses, professionals, and individuals, providing a much-needed solution to the complexities of international money
transfers. As one of the best cryptos for beginners, Qubetics makes it easy for anyone to participate in the global economy without the usual
barriers associated with traditional financial systems. Currently, the crypto presale is in its 25th stage, and more than 499 million $TICS tokens
have been sold, raising over $14.9 million from more than 22,900 holders. This ongoing presale offers $TICS at $0.1074, with analysts predicting
a price surge to $0.25 by the end of the presale, which translates into a potential ROI of 132%. Furthermore, once the presale concludes,
Qubetics could see significant price increases, with forecasts predicting a value of up to $10 per token after the mainnet launch, delivering a jaw-
dropping 9,206% ROI. The Qubetics presale has generated significant buzz due to its impressive performance and the tokenâ€™s projected
growth. With its focus on solving real-life problems, such as cross-border payment challenges, Qubetics stands out as a promising addition to any
crypto portfolio. In fact, some analysts are predicting that $TICS could hit $1 post-presale, offering a potential ROI of 830%. Even more exciting

The crypto marketâ€™s volatility has investors scrambling for stability amid Bitcoinâ€™s recent pullback from all-time highs. While BTC
experiences a correction phase, XRP secures regulatory wins, positioning it for institutional adoption. PEPE navigates challenges after
Binanceâ€™s recent action, BitLemon ($BLEM) is creating unprecedented buzz with its Stage 2 presale nearly 90% sold out and a revenue-
generating platform already live, offering potential returns of up to 900% from current prices to projected listing. Is $BLEMâ€™s 90% Presale
Sellout The Biggest Opportunity Youâ€™re Missing? BitLemons is disrupting the $450 billion traditional casino market with its revolutionary
GambleFi protocol. The fully functional crypto casino features over 8,000 games from premium providers like Evolution and Pragmatic, generating
actual revenue 24/7. An impressive $1.89 million has already been raised, and the Stage 2 presale is 90.49% sold out. Investors are racing to
secure positions with only 3,109,430 BLEM tokens remaining at the current $0.02 price point before the imminent increase to $0.03 in Stage 3
(just 7 days away). The platformâ€™s three exclusive original gamesâ€”$BLEM Keno, Crash by BitLemons, and Wheel of
BitLemonsâ€”generate higher margins by eliminating third-party GGR payments, while the tokenomics allocate 30% of all gaming revenue to token
holders through buybacks and staking rewards. Why Is Wall Streetâ€™s Bitcoin Adoption Failing To Prevent Market Corrections? Despite
institution-friendly ETFs and endorsements from figures like Paul Tudor Jones, Bitcoin has retreated to $77,036.89, down 5.20% as traditional
financeâ€™s entry has paradoxically introduced greater volatility. Many expected institutional adoption would eliminate major corrections, but the
opposite has occurred. Wall Street tradersâ€™ trading patterns differ fundamentally from those of Wall Street traders who focus on shorter
timeframes and liquidity-taking strategies. While long-term fundamentals remain strong, Bitcoinâ€™s correlation with traditional markets has
increased, making it increasingly vulnerable to macroeconomic factors rather than functioning as the â€œdigital goldâ€​ hedge many early adopters
envisioned. Will XRPâ€™s New Licensing Push It To Long-Awaited Price Breakout? XRP has demonstrated remarkable resilience amid
broader market turbulence. Rippleâ€™s expanding U.S. operations through strategic licensing acquisitions position the cryptocurrency for
institutional adoption. Currently trading at $1.95, XRP has maintained critical support levels despite Bitcoinâ€™s correction. Expanding
Rippleâ€™s regulatory-compliant operations signals growing acceptance within traditional finance circles, potentially driving significant utility-based
demand. Technical indicators suggest XRP is coiling for a potential breakout, with the $2.50 level representing the next major resistance. Has
PEPEâ€™s Binance Delisting Created A Buying Opportunity Or Warning Sign? PEPEâ€™s recent delisting as a borrowable asset on Binance
has created mixed sentiment around the popular meme coin. Currently trading at $0.0055398, PEPE has experienced increased volatility as
traders assess the implications of this exchange action. Despite this setback, PEPEâ€™s community remains one of the most engaged in crypto,
with social media metrics showing sustained interest despite price fluctuations. Market watchers remain divided on PEPEâ€™s outlook, with some
pointing to previous exchange actions that temporarily impacted prices before reversals. Is $BLEMâ€™s Revenue-First Model The Future of
Crypto Investment? While Bitcoin, XRP, and PEPE all present distinctive investment cases, none matches BitLemonsâ€™ unique combination of
existing revenue generation, explosive growth potential, and investor-focused tokenomics. Dual security audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof
provide an additional layer of investor protection rarely seen in presale projects, making $ BLEM stand apart from the competition. For investors
seeking the optimal balance of immediate potential, sustainable growth, and verifiable revenue, BitLemons represents the standout opportunity in
todayâ€™s crypto landscape. The only question remaining isnâ€™t whether to invest â€“ itâ€™s how much to allocate before the price inevitably
increases. This has just been announced, win 50,000 USDT in BitLemonsâ€™ $1M giveawayâ€”invest just $50 to enter! - Website:

- Starknet plans to expand Bitcoin use cases by bridging Bitcoin and Ethereum. - StarkWare recently established a Bitcoin strategic reserve.
StarkWare seems to have bigger plans for Bitcoin despite the weak crypto market. It joined the growing list of firms that have established a Bitcoin
strategic reserve. On the other hand, Starknet plans to bridge two major blockchains, Bitcoin and Ethereum, on a single layer 2 network. The firm
is making headlines with this remarkable initiative. Starknet is an Ethereum layer2 network developed by StarkWare. Despite being developed on
the second-major blockchain, Ethereum, the firm has been focusing on Bitcoin research for a while now. The Starknet Foundation recently
published a Bitcoin Roadmap and outlined its ambitious plans for Bitcoin. Starknet Unveils Bitcoin Development Plans Starknet CEO Ben-Sasson
not only perceives Bitcoin as a mere store of value, he looks at the enormous potential it holds for real-time utility. To bring this vision forward, the
firm revealed several plans they have for the Bitcoin blockchain. A Bitcoin wallet called Xverse is going to integrate with Starknet and allow users
to access Bitcoin assets such as Ordinals on its network. Its Foundation is launching the â€œBTCFi Seasonâ€​ to offer yield opportunities on
Bitcoin through the network. The initiative aims to bring DeFi use cases to Bitcoin holders. Starknet also aims to become the first layer 2 network
to unify two major blockchains, Bitcoin and Ethereum. The firm believes Bitcoin is limited to a store of value, and it proposes to be the execution
layer for Bitcoin blockchain. Once the firm achieves its vision, it could open doors to numerous possibilities. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin
also supported Starknetâ€™s plans regarding Bitcoin. Lack of scalability is one of the major issues of Bitcoin blockchain, and Starknet aims to
change that with its plans to bridge Bitcoin with Ethereum. Highlighted Crypto News Today: HYPE Token Drops as Whale Liquidation Triggers

- Metaplanet has raised 2 billion yen through an interest-free bond to expand its Bitcoin portfolio. - The company has recently acquired 162 more
Bitcoin for its treasury. Japanese investment company Metaplanet Inc. has said it plans to sell 2 billion yen, or about $13.4 million worth of
interest-free regular bonds as part of its approach to acquiring Bitcoin. The action makes Metaplanet one of Asiaâ€™s largest corporate Bitcoin
owners in a repeat of strategies first set by U.S.-based MicroStrategy. Significantly, Metaplanetâ€™s Board of Directors approved the issuance
of its 8th Series of ordinary bonds. The entire bond issuance is being allocated to EVO FUND. Each bond carries a face value of 50 million yen,
and bondholders are allowed early redemption options. The bonds are set for full redemption on September 11, 2025. Also, it aims to minimize
the companyâ€™s debt service burden. To manage repayment, Metaplanet plans to exercise its 14th to 17th stock subscription rights. Bitcoin
Treasury Surpasses 3,000 BTC With the latest Bitcoin Treasury Operations, Metaplanet recently acquired an additional 162 BTC at an average
purchase price of 12,393,669 yen per Bitcoin. Following this acquisition, the firmâ€™s Bitcoin reserve now stands at 3,050 BTC. Conversely,
Metaplanet has placed a very aggressive goal for its Bitcoin buying plan. The company plans to accumulate 10,000 BTC by the year 2025 and
eventually achieve 21,000 BTC by 2026. Furthermore, by issuing interest-free bonds and leveraging Japanâ€™s low-interest rate environment,
Metaplanet is employing a strategy similar to that of MicroStrategy, rebranded as Strategy. Metaplanetâ€™s strategy has led to it being dubbed
the â€œAsian MicroStrategy.â€​ Ever since April 2024, the company has continually added to its Bitcoin reserves, making it a leading institutional
player in the digital assets space. Besides, the biggest asset, Bitcoin, has been on the bear wave for the past few days. BTC spiked by 1% at press
time, trading at $82.3K. Daily trading volume has plunged by 20.21% to $47.27 billion. Highlighted Crypto News
- Bitcoin spikes 5.48% yesterday, trading at $81,820 with a $1.62 trillion market cap. - Broader market rally fueled by Bitcoin Act Bill and US-
Ukraine ceasefire agreement. Major cryptocurrencies, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, showed positive movement as the broader market started
to recover. The crypto market capitalization stands at $2.65 trillion while showing a 2.73% increase during the previous 24 hours. The market
recovery may be indicated by this recent upward trend. Bitcoinâ€™s price spiked by a phenomenal 5.48% yesterday, with the price opening at
$78,599 and touching a high of $83,568. Later, the price closed at $82,869. According to CoinMarketCap data, the Bitcoin market value stands
at $81,820 while showing a 2.08% increase in its daily price, which signals positive market sentiment. The daily trading volume decreased by
19.06%, while the volume-to-market ratio reached 2.9%. The market capitalization stands at $1.62 trillion and the daily trading activity reaches
$47.7 billion. Besides Bitcoin, XRP and Cardano also showed uptick. XRP price took a bounce from its lower support of $1.897 and touched a
high of $2.213, a 7.51% intraday surge. On the other hand ADA also showed some remarkable surge with a 7.93% of change. It took a bounce
from $0.6472 and reached a high of $0.7450, according to Tradingview data. Why the Market Bounced Back? There are several catalysts behind
the broader market recovery. On March 11, Senator Cynthia Lummis reintroduced the Bitcoin Act Bill in the US Congress which aligns with
President Trumpâ€™s promise. And just before the White House Crypto Summit, Trump had already signed an order to create a â€œStrategic
Bitcoin Reserve.â€​ Another reason is that Ukraine has agreed to a United States offer for a 30-day ceasefire in its war with Russia. All these
became a catalyst for the broader market rally in the last 2 days. Highlighted Crypto News Today:
- Germanyâ€™s Deutsche Boerse has announced launching Bitcoin and Ether Institutional Custody. - There has been a surge in crypto adoption
across Europe over the past few months. The recent market crash has sparked tremendous debate within the digital assets community. While most
take a negative outlook, a few members such as asset manager Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood have a varied perspective. Wood believes that this
could be the final leg of a rolling recession, meaning upward movements could follow. On the other hand, Europe has been growing its crypto
adoption irrespective of current market conditions. Notably, Germany-based exchange group, Deutsche Boerse announced plans to launch a
Bitcoin and Ether institutional custody. Through this venture, Deutscheâ€™s trading unit Clearstorm aims to enhance its user experience for
institutional clients. The firm also will include settlement services for Bitcoin and Ether transactions for its 2500 institutional clients. Jens
Hachmeister, Clearstreamâ€™s Issuer Head stated: â€œWith this offering, we are creating a one-stop shop around custody, brokerage and
settlement,â€​ Moreover, in order to facilitate this process, Clearstrom is partnering with Deutsche Boerseâ€™s Switzerland-subsidiary Crypto
Finance AG. The exchange group also plans to expand services to include staking, lending, and brokerage capabilities in the future. Is
Germanyâ€™s Deutsche Boerse an Indication of European Adoption Surge? Over the past two months, there has been a surge in crypto
adoption on a global level. Deutsche Boerseâ€™s recent venture stands testimonial to this recent shift in attitude towards crypto assets particularly
within Europe. Moreover, Germany also recently saw its Ex-Finance Minister, Christian Linder push for a Bitcoin adoption in the country.
Previously,in July 2024, the German government sold 50K BTC tokens that were seized in a cryptocurrency fraud. Another prominent German
bank, Commerzbank also initiated Bitcoin and Ethereum trading in September 2024. While the nation still receives criticism for its July BTC sale,
recent positive instances might shift community membersâ€™ perspectives. Highlighted Crypto News Today: Arkham token ARKM Surges 14%
Following Upbit Listing Amid Market Slump
- Mt. Gox moved 32,371 BTC ($2.19B) to new wallets, its largest monthly transfer. - Bitcoin trades at $80,378, down 2.51%, with resistance at
$85,000 and support at $78,000. Defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox moved 32,371 BTC ($2.19 billion) to new wallets on Monday, marking its
largest transfer in months, according to Arkham Intelligence. The movement has sparked speculation about potential creditor repayments. Most of
the Bitcoin 30,371 BTC was sent to wallet â€œ1FG2Câ€¦Rveoyâ€​, while 2,000 BTC initially landed in Mt. Goxâ€™s cold wallet before being
moved to an unmarked address. Last week, the exchange transferred 500 BTC to two unknown wallets. The reason for these transfers remains
unclear. However, past movements have often preceded repayments through centralized exchanges such as Bitstamp and Kraken. Some analysts
believe this could be an early step toward reimbursing creditors, while others suggest Mt. Gox may be testing wallets before larger distributions.
The recent transfers come after the exchange postponed its creditor repayment deadline from October 31, 2024, to October 31, 2025. Originally,
Mt. Gox planned to distribute 141,686 BTC among creditors, but delays have caused frustration. The trustee previously cited operational and
security concerns for the postponement. Bitcoin in Todayâ€™s Market At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $80,378.74, down 2.51% in 24
hours. The market cap has fallen to $1.59 trillion, while trading volume surged 51.27% to $59.57 billion. Bitcoin faces resistance at $85,000, with
support at $78,000 and $75,000. The RSI at 37.97 signals oversold conditions, while a Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) of -0.04 indicates weak
buying pressure. Mt. Goxâ€™s latest Bitcoin transfers have reignited speculation about creditor repayments, though no official announcement has
been made. Mt. Gox collapsed in 2014 after losing 850,000 BTC to a hack, making it one of the largest failures in crypto history. In recent years,
the exchange has recovered around 200,000 BTC, which is set to be repaid to creditors. However, the timeline remains uncertain. Highlighted
Crypto News Today How Low Could Ethereum (ETH) Drop in the Next 7 Days?
- Bitcoin has factored in a modest price drop of 2.39% in the last 24 hours. - The cryptocurrency tested a support level of $76,707 in the past day
as per CMC data. While community members raise havoc by watching their largest profits disappear, analysts remain positive. Over the past few
weeks, several experts had predicted that Bitcoin and the alt sector would retract the bull run before bouncing back up. As this materializes into
reality, speculations of a bigger cycle arise. Notably, in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin has factored in a modest price drop of 2.39%. This drop,
however, caused it to break the $80,000 support in the late evening hours of March 10. Presently, the cryptocurrency is dabbling across the $79K
-$80K border. However, as aforementioned analysts predict further dips. Inferring its daily price chart, Bitcoin depicts combating the $82K
resistance in the morning hours of March 10, after which it gave in to bears. Its intra-day low stands at $76,707, meanwhile, experts such as
Arthur Hayes field mark $69,000 as the next key support. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $80,277 as per CMC data. Moreover, Ali
also outlined how the third year of a bull run tends to be unpredictable from historic data. He stated that the year tends to hold uncertainty,
volatility, and big shakeouts, on the other hand, traders who navigate it tend to land profits. Is the Bitcoin Drop Part of a Bigger Bull Cycle?
Multiple market experts including the aforementioned have viewed the recent dip as essential for an incoming rebound in Bitcoin price. In case of
further downward movements, the digital asset might test support levels of $76,496 and $74,785 in the coming days. With the current movements
mirroring expertsâ€™ predictions, this recent move might be part of a bigger bull cycle. Additionally, Bitcoinâ€™s bear power indicator value
stands at -5.07 while the bull power indicator stands at 0.69. This further confirms the bearish market dominance. The resultant sell-offs have
caused the RSI value to dip to 35.55 as per TradingView data. Finally, the largest cryptocurrencyâ€™s price drop can be seen reflected in other
altcoins such as Ethereum and Solana.
Bitcoin and Shiba Inu have long dominated headlines as icons of the crypto revolution. Bitcoin, the undisputed pioneer, turned early adopters into
millionaires. Shiba Inu, the playful meme token, skyrocketed to fame with its viral growth and meme-fueled momentum. But ask any experienced
investor, and theyâ€™ll tell youâ€”these giants have had their time. The spectacular returns they once offered are now a thing of the past. If
youâ€™re hunting for a life-changing opportunity in cryptocurrency, look beyond yesterdayâ€™s successes. Letâ€™s talk about BinoFi (BINO),
the rising-star token that could eclipse the golden days of its predecessors. Cryptocurrency prizes innovators, and BinoFi is proving to be just that,
a player set to shake up the way we trade and invest in digital assets. Analysts are beginning to whisper about its potential for exponential returns,
with some suggesting it could transform a modest $5,000 investment today into half a million dollars by the close of 2025. Daring? Sure. But
thereâ€™s a growing case for why this hybrid crypto exchange and ecosystem might just live up to the buildup. A Fresh Start with Proven
Innovation What sets BinoFi apart is its raw potential and wide-reaching vision. At a time when the crypto market is full of fragmented trading
systems and security concerns, BinoFi steps in to bridge the gaps. Its hybrid exchange model borrows the speed and liquidity of centralized
platforms and pairs them with the transparency and user autonomy of decentralization. Yet, this isnâ€™t simply another evolutionary
stepâ€”itâ€™s a reimagining of what trading can and should be. Beyond sophisticated trading mechanics, BinoFi introduces meaningful usability
upgrades. Its Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallets, for instance, balance security with simplicity, eliminating barriers that scare off everyday
users. BinoFiâ€™s cross-chain functionality, allowing direct asset swaps across separate blockchains without bridges, feels less like an upgrade
and more like a complete reinvention of interoperability. This is where investors see a spark reminiscent of Bitcoinâ€™s early days or Shiba
Inuâ€™s youthful rise, a project that isnâ€™t simply catering to the market but leading it toward its next frontier. And thatâ€™s enough to ignite
imagination and excitement, especially during a time when top tokens feel more like slow, lumbering institutions than explosive opportunities. The
Presale Thatâ€™s Turning Heads A central piece of BinoFiâ€™s story lies in its presaleâ€”A bold entryway into the market designed not just to
raise funds, but to prime early adopters for extraordinary gains. Savvy crypto investors know that presales can offer a golden ticket. With lower
prices and exclusive perks, they provide a rare opportunity to invest in a token before it hits the major exchanges and gains mainstream attention.
For BinoFi, this moment represents more than an early-stage token offering. Itâ€™s a statementâ€”this project isnâ€™t here to blend in. Itâ€™s
here to dominate. The presale is structured to attract long-term investors, offering substantial bonuses and incentives for early contributors. These
arenâ€™t just empty gestures but designed to ensure compounding benefits for participants who join during its infancy. Importantly, the presale
also reflects the projectâ€™s commitment to long-term growth, with detailed mechanisms to stabilize the token price and foster trust. Industry
whispers suggest major institutional players are eyeing the presale, which underscores its significance. And with incentives aimed at rewarding the
first movers, smaller retail investors have a distinct advantage if they act quickly. Predictions Heading Toward 2025 Fueled by its hybrid
technology, unique trading model, and a rising demand for decentralization and interoperability, analysts predict rapid adoption once the token is
fully launched. Early estimations suggest a valuation that could rival mid-cap cryptocurrencies within two years, with a trajectory that mirrors the
meteoric initial growth of projects like Solana. By 2025, investor models project BinoFi hitting milestones that would make current prices seem
laughably low. Its current entry point, accessible to practically any retail investor, offers the kind of upside rarely seen since Bitcoinâ€™s days. But
raw profits aside, what really drives these predictions is the ecosystem itself. BinoFi isnâ€™t being built as a trendy, hyped-up token, itâ€™s
being designed as a critical infrastructure layer that could quietly and consistently power an overlooked corner of the crypto market. This is how
the biggest winners emerge, not by copying trends but by creating them. Why Timing Matters Anyone who has watched the crypto space long
enough knows that timing is everything, Bitcoin in 2011, Ethereum in 2014 and Solana in 2020. Miss those moments, and your portfolio reflects
the difference. BinoFiâ€™s current stage feels just like one of those pivotal market moments. Itâ€™s in its infancyâ€”underpriced, under-hyped,
but undeniably positioned to capitalize on massive structural changes across the industry. The question isnâ€™t whether BinoFi will grow, but how
far. For investors still waiting on the sidelines, this moment might well be the last stop before BinoFiâ€™s trajectory takes off into uncharted
heights. - Website: https://binofi.com - Whitepaper: https://whitepaper.binofi.com - Telegram: https://t.me/binofilabs - Twitter:

- SGX will launch Bitcoin perpetual futures in H2 2025 for institutional clients. - The offering is pending approval from the Monetary Authority of
Singapore. Singapore Exchange Ltd. (SGX) plans to launch Bitcoin perpetual futures in the second half of 2025. The offering will cater exclusively
to institutional clients and professional investors. Retail traders will not have access, according to a Bloomberg report. The planned contracts are
still awaiting regulatory approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Unlike traditional futures, perpetual contracts have no expiration date.
They allow traders to speculate on Bitcoinâ€™s price movements continuously. This move aligns with the broader trend of traditional exchanges
embracing crypto derivatives. Japanâ€™s Osaka Dojima Exchange Inc. is also seeking approval to list Bitcoin futures. Institutional interest in
cryptocurrency is increasing, particularly amid pro-crypto policies from the U.S. government. Expanding Institutional Crypto Access SGXâ€™s
spokesperson stated that the exchange expects its offering to â€œsignificantly expand institutional market access.â€​ The initiative may also help
address credit risks tied to unregulated platforms like Binance and OKX. Offshore exchanges currently dominate the perpetual futures market, but
SGX aims to bring regulatory oversight to this space. Singapore has positioned itself as a key hub for cryptocurrency businesses. Regulatory clarity
and institutional-friendly policies have attracted firms seeking a compliant market. Robinhood Crypto is also expanding its presence in Singapore.
The company acquired Bitstamp for $200 million in 2024 and aims to launch crypto services in the country by late 2025. Bitstamp received in-
principle approval from Singaporeâ€™s regulators last year. The exchange will act as a gateway for Robinhoodâ€™s entry into the Singaporean
market. With more financial institutions embracing crypto, SGXâ€™s move strengthens its role as a bridge between traditional finance and digital
assets. The exchangeâ€™s Bitcoin perpetual futures could offer institutions a secure alternative to unregulated derivatives markets. If approved,
the offering will likely attract major trading firms seeking compliance and security in crypto investments. Highlighted Crypto News Today Unknown
Attack on Pectra Upgrade Further Delays Launch on Mainnet
- Spainâ€™s second-largest bank, BBVA, has secured approval to offer Bitcoin and Ether trading. - The move aligns with the shift in European
banking as institutions race to comply with MiCA regulations. Spainâ€™s banking giant Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) has been
approved by the countryâ€™s securities regulator, the ComisiÃ³n Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV), to offer Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether
(ETH) trading services. BBVA now will allow clients to buy, sell, and manage digital assets directly through its official mobile banking app. Unlike
third-party crypto platforms, the bank will provide custody services using its own cryptographic key management system. Initially, access will be
limited to select users before rolling out to all private clients in the coming months. BBVA is valued at around $840 billion, and this expansion
follows a trend of traditional financial institutions moving into the crypto space. Now that regulations around digital assets are solidifying, major
banks are already positioning themselves to satisfy the growing demand for secure crypto services. A Strategic Expansion Historically,
BBVAâ€™s crypto journey began in Switzerland. In 2021, the bank introduced Bitcoin trading and custody services for private banking clients
under the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). Later, it expanded those offerings to include Ethereum and the USDC
stablecoin. In January 2024, BBVA took another decisive step by launching crypto trading in Turkey through its subsidiary, Garanti BBVA
Kripto. Now, with regulatory approval in Spain, the bank continues to widen its crypto recognition across Europe. Meanwhile, BBVA has been
preparing for this expansion since 2020 but waited for clearer regulations and a healthy crypto environment. With Spain now on board, the bank is
strengthening its position as a leader in crypto adoption within traditional finance. MiCA Compliance Fuels Institutional Crypto Adoption
BBVAâ€™s approval comes at the right time, as the European Unionâ€™s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation is now fully in effect.
This will bring a structured framework to digital asset services across the region. While companies have until July 2026 to achieve full compliance,
many financial institutions are moving quickly to align with the new standards. Since MiCAâ€™s rollout, both traditional banks and crypto-native
firms have been racing to secure regulatory approval. For instance, Hidden Road obtained its MiCA license in the Netherlands, while Standard
Chartered received approval in Luxembourg, and Boerse Stuttgart Digital Custody became Germanyâ€™s first MiCA-licensed crypto service
provider in January. Crypto exchanges are also adjusting. OKX, Crypto.com, and HashKey all secured MiCA approval earlier this year.
Meanwhile, Bybit, which suffered a record-breaking hack, recently made headlines by getting removed from Franceâ€™s blacklist as it works
toward regulatory compliance. BBVAâ€™s move signals that mainstream banks are no longer sidelining crypto. Instead, theyâ€™re integrating it
within traditional banking services, making digital assets more accessible to everyday investors. Highlighted Crypto News for Today Arkham
Report: WLF Portfolio Sinks and Ethereum Buys in Major Loss
- The Utah government has become the first to pass a Bitcoin bill soon to become law. - Bitcoin has fallen once again to the $82K level in the last
24 hours. While the crypto market has receded to the bearish end over the weekend, community members seem to have come to terms with it.
Bitcoin has slid to the $82K level and external factors appear to not suffice as propellants. However, the sector itself has not gone dormant, as
activity is still on the upward direction. Notably, a few hours ago, the US State of Utah announced news of a Bitcoin bill, which caught market
attention. According to the bill, it creates authority to the state treasurer for investing in digital assets. Furthermore it also prohibits state entities to
restrict acceptance or custody of digital assets. Following several other US states, Utah is the latest to join in line to authorize state government
investments in Bitcoin and the other digital assets. However, the bill failed to include an amendment that would allow the state treasurer to invest in
Bitcoin. Moreover, this amendment would have made Utah the first state in the US to actually pass a Bitcoin Reserve bill. However, currently, it
only provides basic custody protections for Utah citizens. The aforementioned amendment would have allowed the state treasurer to invest up to
5% in Bitcoin. Why Did the Utah Senate Deny Rights of Bitcoin Investment? According to reports, the reserve clause passed the second reading
but was removed before the third and final reading. However the bill has been passed and is now headed to the Governor for being converted into
law. Meanwhile, Bitcoin, as aforementioned, has remained in the $82,000 range for the past day. It has factored in a drop of 4.23% in the last 24
hours to reach the current level. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $82,196 as per CMC data. On the other hand, the Canadian
nationâ€™s new Prime Minister, Mark Carneyâ€™s once uttered negative views on Bitcoin seem to have caught market attention. Community
members are wondering if this might result in Canadaâ€™s crypto landscape shifting. Highlighted Crypto News Today: 600K Ethereum
Withdrawn From Exchanges in the Last 7Days â€” How Will It Impact ETH?
- Bitcoin must stay above $82K to avoid $1.13 billion in liquidations and increased volatility following Bitcoin reserve - Investor sentiment
weakened after Trumpâ€™s Bitcoin reserve plan excluded new BTC purchases. - Upcoming U.S. economic data, including CPI and job reports,
could impact Bitcoinâ€™s price. The price trajectory of Bitcoin is in danger as it hovers around the critical $82,000 support level. Analysts warn
that a weekly close below this level can trigger over $1.13 billion worth of leveraged long liquidations on exchanges. Which is leading to heightened
volatility for the crypto market. Trumpâ€™s Bitcoin Reserve and Market Reaction The recent price weakness follows an executive order signed
by then U.S. President Donald Trump on March 7. The order outlined proposals to establish a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve using seized Bitcoin
from criminal cases. This move disappointed investors who were eagerly awaiting outright federal Bitcoin purchases as a demonstration of
institutional endorsement. Bitfinex analysts stated that the lack of active government investment led to short-term bearish sentiment, contributing to
the decline in Bitcoinâ€™s price. â€œInvestors wanted federal accumulation to be a sign of robust institutional support, maybe to push prices
higher. But using holdings that are based on today allowed expectations to remain in check,â€​ Bitfinex analysts explained. Macroeconomic
Developments Other than the regulation decisions, Bitcoinâ€™s price is still influenced by macroeconomic developments. Nexo analyst Iliya
Kalchev mentioned that Bitcoinâ€™s short-term prices will be influenced by future U.S. releases. Everyone will be holding their breath next week
for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and job openings report. Those numbers will inform us of inflation trends and labor market health, and that
will be something that will influence investor sentiment,â€​ Kalchev said. If inflation slows down and labor market conditions worsen, expectations
for interest rate cuts could increase, which would be beneficial for Bitcoin as a diversification vehicle. Alternatively, stronger-than-anticipated
economic news may continue to place downward pressure on the price of Bitcoin. Technical Indicators Despite the bearishness, some technical
indicators say that Bitcoin is near a local bottom. Relative Strength Index (RSI), or a measurement of whether or not an asset is overbought or
oversold, reads 28 on the daily chart. Historically, whenever the RSI for Bitcoin is around this number, the price bottomed or came within
2%â€“8% of doing so. If Bitcoin ends the week higher at above $82,000, it can send a message to change sentiment and help mend investor
confidence. But a break below will bring more volatility to the lower side, and so traders and investors hold their breath for that to happen. As the
market is processing Trumpâ€™s reserve approach to Bitcoin and macroeconomic developments. Thus, everyone sits and waits and observes if
Bitcoin maintains its critical support level for the next several days.
Reflecting on Bitcoinâ€™s inception, one might wonder: what if the opportunity to invest in its early stages had been seized? Launched in 2009 by
the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin introduced the world to decentralized digital currency. Initially, Bitcoin had no monetary value, with
early transactions involving the exchange of thousands of bitcoins for minimal goods, such as the famous purchase of two pizzas for 10,000 BTC in
2010. The cryptocurrency market continually presents new opportunities for those who missed out on Bitcoinâ€™s meteoric rise. One such
prospect is Qubetics, a project that aims to revolutionize the crypto experience with its innovative solutions. As the digital asset landscape evolves,
identifying the best cryptos to buy this month becomes crucial for investors seeking substantial returns. Qubetics: A Modern Solution with Its Non-
Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet A significant challenge in the cryptocurrency realm is managing assets across multiple blockchains. Traditional wallets
often support limited networks, compelling users to maintain several wallets for different cryptocurrencies. This fragmentation not only complicates
asset management but also exposes users to security risks associated with multiple platforms. Qubetics addresses this issue with its Non-Custodial
Multi-Chain Wallet. This wallet empowers users to manage assets across various blockchains without relinquishing control to third parties. For
instance, a business operating in Argentina can effortlessly transfer funds from Ethereum to Solana, optimizing transaction fees and speeds.
Professionals in Brazil can securely manage their diverse crypto portfolios, ensuring they have full autonomy over their assets. Qubeticsâ€™
presale is in its 24th stage, with tokens priced at $0.0976 each. The crypto presale has raised over $14.7 million, with more than 22,500 token
holders and over 497 million $TICS tokens sold. Projections suggest that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, offering a potential
return on investment (ROI) of 156%. Post-mainnet launch, forecasts indicate that $TICS could reach $10, translating to an impressive 10,137%
ROI. Bitcoin: The Pioneer of Cryptocurrency Bitcoinâ€™s creation in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto marked the beginning of decentralized digital
currency. Unlike traditional investments, Bitcoin did not have a formal Initial Coin Offering (ICO). Instead, the first bitcoins were mined through a
process that rewarded early adopters with 50 BTC per block. Since there was no market for Bitcoin initially, its first real-world transaction
occurred in May 2010, when 10,000 BTC. As Bitcoinâ€™s utility and scarcity became more apparent, it began gaining recognition as a store of
value, evolving from a niche technology experiment into a globally traded asset with a total market capitalization exceeding $1 trillion at its peak.
The limited supply of 21 million BTC contributed to its price appreciation. Early adopters who mined or purchased Bitcoin for just a few cents per
coin eventually saw their holdings grow to staggering values. By 2021, Bitcoin had reached an all-time high of $69,000, making it one of the best-
performing assets in financial history. Conclusion Regretting a missed opportunity is a common sentiment in cryptocurrency investing, and
Bitcoinâ€™s historical growth serves as a reminder of how early-stage investments in disruptive technologies can lead to significant returns.
Qubetics stands out by addressing the multi-chain asset management problem, offering a Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet that allows users to
seamlessly manage and transfer assets across different blockchains without relying on third parties. This technological advancement positions
Qubetics as a strong contender among the best cryptos to buy this month. With an active crypto presale, robust development roadmap, and a
growing participant base, Qubetics presents an opportunity that mirrors the early days of Bitcoin. For More Information: - Qubetics:

The cryptocurrency market has become both a wellspring of opportunity and a labyrinth of challenges for investors. With over 20,000 active digital
currencies and daily market volatility, separating the next big opportunity from fleeting hype is no small feat. While Bitcoin and Ethereum continue
to dominate as colossal forces in the industry, they face growing criticism for high transaction costs, scalability issues, and limitations in their
adaptability. Among this backdrop, a brand-new token is stepping into the spotlightâ€”BinoFi (BINO). Priced at just $0.02 during its current
presale phase, BinoFi is generating discussions as a future-first cryptocurrency with Ethereum and Bitcoin-like potential, but without the barriers
that have made these giants increasingly inaccessible to new investors. The Current Crypto Landscape Despite occasional market pullbacks,
cryptocurrency remains a thriving force, capturing the imagination of both retail investors and institutions. Bitcoin has long been cryptoâ€™s crown
jewel, paving the way as a store of value and digital alternative to gold. Ethereum, meanwhile, revolutionized the space with its pioneering smart
contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Yet both assets, for all their contributions, highlight a critical challenge in the market, barriers to
usability and growth caused by their very success. Bitcoinâ€™s widespread popularity elongates transaction times, while Ethereumâ€™s network
regularly faces congestion, driving gas fees to exorbitant heights. These issues make navigating the crypto world difficult, particularly for first-time
investors or those working with limited capital. Investors have started looking for assets with room for explosive growth and solutions that push
blockchain technology forward. Emerging tokens like BinoFi (BINO) are capturing attention by addressing head-on the shortcomings of the
leaders, with a focus on user accessibility, speed, and important technical innovation. What Sets BinoFi Apart? At the core of BinoFiâ€™s appeal
is its groundbreaking hybrid crypto exchange. Described as the first of its kind, this exchange combines the speed and liquidity of centralized
exchanges (CEXs) with the transparency and decentralization of decentralized exchanges (DEXs). By merging the strengths of these models,
BinoFiâ€™s ecosystem is solving key pain points for traders and investors alike. These features position BinoFi as a leader in trust, engagement,
and privacy within the crypto market. Unique Features Driving Its Success BinoFi stands out in the crypto space with its innovative features
designed to enhance transparency, engagement, and compliance. It offers Live Proof-of-Reserves, allowing users to verify that all funds are fully
backed in real-time, and Immutable Audit Trails for tracking trade execution and system integrity. Its Trade-to-Earn model rewards users for
trading activity, while Copy Trading lets beginners replicate the strategies of top investors, enabling both new and experienced traders to benefit.
Additionally, BinoFi ensures privacy with Zero-Knowledge (ZK) KYC, allowing users to verify their identity without exposing personal data, and
adapts compliance requirements based on user location for smooth global operations. Expert Opinions and Early Success Industry analysts are
starting to take note. â€œBinoFi is part of the next generation of crypto, offering a more user-centric and scalable approach than many of its
predecessors,â€​ says one blockchain industry analyst. The strong demand analysts observe is evidenced by BinoFiâ€™s presale event. More than
3 million tokens sold out within hours, underscoring its ability to capture investor interest. Market insiders suggest that early adopters see not just
novelty in BinoFi, but fundamentals capable of driving long-term value. Testimonials from some of the earliest community members echo these
sentiments. â€œIâ€™ve invested in a fair share of tokens over the years,â€​ says an individual token holder, â€œbut BinoFi feels different. Its
hybrid exchange is a game-changer, addressing so many pain points weâ€™ve just learned to tolerate in crypto.â€​ The Verdict The momentum
keeps building, thanks to key developments like BinoFiâ€™s recent listing on CoinMarketCap, which has expanded its visibility and enhanced its
market credibility. For investors, this offers a rare chance to get involved early in a project with monumental potential. With predictions suggesting
BinoFiâ€™s price could skyrocket to $1.00 in the coming years, the 50x ROI opportunity is hard to ignore. - Website: https://binofi.com -

Investors who recognized early opportunities in cryptoâ€™s biggest winners saw life-changing gains. Now, the same pattern is unfolding, but this
time, itâ€™s happening in a booming, $450 billion industry that never sleeps. Will you be the one who got in early, or the one who regrets missing
out? The latest executive order establishing the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is a clear signâ€”Bitcoin is becoming an institutional asset, no longer
the peopleâ€™s crypto. Traders are already reacting, with BTC surging past $92K before crashing back to $87K, leaving many wondering if
Bitcoinâ€™s best days are behind it. Meanwhile, BitLemons ($BLEM) isnâ€™t waiting for the market to decide its fate. With a fully operational
revenue model, real gaming profits, and a price thatâ€™s already doubling in presale, itâ€™s proving that the real money isnâ€™t in
waitingâ€”itâ€™s in winning. BTCâ€™s Grip is Slipping, $BLEM is Taking the Lead Bitcoin remains the most recognized digital asset, but
recognition doesnâ€™t always translate to strong, consistent returns. While BTC battles institutional control and unpredictable market cycles,
BitLemons is delivering direct, revenue-backed value to investors. The difference is clear. While Bitcoin relies on market sentiment and institutional
buy-in, BitLemons is generating actual revenue through its gaming platform. The crypto casino industry operates around the clock, generating
profits 24/7, giving investors a business-backed token rather than one driven by speculation. Why $BLEM Is Winning Where Bitcoin Stalls
Bitcoinâ€™s early appeal was rooted in financial freedom, but the landscape has changed. Governments are now holding Bitcoin in reserves, and
state-led initiatives in Texas and Utah are reinforcing institutional dominance over the asset. As a result, Bitcoinâ€™s market behavior is
increasingly dictated by institutional traders rather than retail investors. This shift has created uncertainty, leading many to explore opportunities that
provide more than just potential future appreciation. BitLemons is already proving itself in a high-growth sector. The platform is fully operational,
with thousands of casino games from top-tier providers like Evolution and Pragmatic. Investors arenâ€™t waiting on regulatory decisions or
institutional movesâ€”theyâ€™re earning through GambleFi rewards tied directly to gaming revenue. BTCâ€™s Instability is $BLEMâ€™s
Opportunity Bitcoinâ€™s price action is a rollercoaster of uncertainty. After hitting $92K, it tumbled back to $87K, and traders are eyeing the
$85K support level to see if it holds. With the White House set to discuss crypto regulation, the market is in wait-and-see mode. Meanwhile,
BitLemons investors arenâ€™t waitingâ€”theyâ€™re stacking early gains. Stage 1 of the presale sold out in just 16 days, and Stage 2 is already
76% gone. With the next price increase from $0.02 to $0.03 just a few days away, those getting in now are securing their spot before the market
catches up. Investors in the first round have already doubled their money, and with a rumored listing price of $0.17-$0.18, the upside is clear.
While Bitcoin investors debate government involvement, BitLemons investors are cashing in. Numbers Donâ€™t Lie, Strategies Do Bitcoin is a
market-driven asset, but BitLemons is a revenue-driven one. Thatâ€™s the difference. With 30% of Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) fueling the
token economy, holders benefit from a model designed for long-term sustainability, not speculation. Fifteen percent of revenue is allocated to
buybacks, ensuring that price appreciation is backed by real moneyâ€”not just hype. Another 15% is distributed as staking rewards, creating a
passive income stream that Bitcoin simply canâ€™t offer. Bitcoinâ€™s future depends on external factors like regulation, institutions, and macro
trends. BitLemonsâ€™ future is tied to direct gaming revenue that never stops. Grab $BLEM Before the Next Stage Hits The current price of
$BLEM is locked at $0.02, but time is running out. In just a few days, the price jumps to $0.03, and demand is increasing fast. Stage 1 sold out in
just 16 days, and Stage 2 is already 76% filled. The opportunity to secure an early position is closing quickly, and with momentum building toward
the public launch, waiting could cost you. Bitcoin has had its moment. Now itâ€™s trading sideways, battling volatility, and facing institutional
control. Meanwhile, BitLemons is surging ahead with real adoption, real revenue, and real profits. Youâ€™ve seen this happen beforeâ€”some
will wait and watch, others will act and win. Join the Revenue Revolution with BitLemons ($BLEM) Today! [Disclaimer: This article is for

- XRP, Solana, and Cardano dropped due to Bitcoin reserve, thus Trump clarified only Bitcoin would receive active support. - Meme coins like
Dogecoin and Shiba Inu fell due to unconfirmed reserve inclusion. - The crypto market dropped 4%, with uncertainty lingering ahead of the White
House Crypto Summit. The crypto market has witnessed high volatility today, with top altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP
experiencing price drops. President Donald Trumpâ€™s recent executive order to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve first fueled hopes of a wider
U.S. push into crypto. But these altcoins are falling as the market responds to conflicting signals. XRP, Solana, and Cardano Dropped despite
Bitcoin reserve XRP, Solana, and Cardano enjoyed a brief burst of optimism after being included in Trumpâ€™s reserve plan. But the optimism
did not last long after Trump made it clear. The government would actively support only Bitcoin, while other coins such as XRP, Solana, and
Cardano. Would only be included in the reserve if governments confiscated them. XRP dipped 2%, Solana lost 5%, and Cardano dipped 10%.
This change suppressed investor sentiment and precipitated a sell-off, eliminating recent gains. The anticipation that the U.S. government would
diversify its crypto reserves was dispelled, further fueling the downtrend in the market. Meme Coins declined Meme coins such as Dogecoin
(DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe Coin (PEPE) reflected the general market decline after bitcoin reserve announcement. DOGE declined 5%,
SHIB fell by 2%, and PEPE lost 6%. Earlier this week, rumors had circulated that DOGE could be added to the reserve, triggering a brief price
increase. But with no official support from Trumpâ€™s proposal, the gains were short-lived. The overall crypto market experienced a drop of
almost 4%, with the worldâ€™s market capitalization reducing to $2.88 trillion. The reserveâ€™s under-diversification has instilled doubts in
investors. Although the prices did fall, tokens such as MOVE, Sui, and Jito recorded some positive gains, yet the market is still bearish. White
House Crypto Summit All eyes now shift to the White House Crypto Summit for possible policy updates that would give insight into the future of
U.S. crypto rules. Investors are optimistic about a more open-minded approach, but hopes are low. The market, meanwhile, will probably
continue to suffer from uncertainty as traders readjust their strategies because of the volatile market atmosphere. Trumpâ€™s Bitcoin reserve
announcement was a step forward for the crypto space, the market remains volatile, and investor confidence in altcoins is wavering. Highlighted
Crypto News Today 4 Bullish Reasons Why Trumpâ€™s Bitcoin Reserve Is a Game Changer
- The U.S. holding Bitcoin reserve reduces regulatory risks, making a ban highly unlikely and boosting investor confidence. - Institutional and
global adoption may accelerate as governments and financial entities recognize Bitcoinâ€™s legitimacy. - Bitcoinâ€™s status as â€œdigital goldâ€​
strengthens, solidifying its role in the future of global finance. The world of cryptocurrency has just taken a drastic turn with former U.S. President
Donald Trumpâ€™s executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). The development has triggered a combination of optimism and
skepticism in the crypto community. Although Bitcoin initially experienced a 6% price decline, most experts feel that this move will have positive
long-term implications. A Step Towards Bitcoin Adoption The U.S. governmentâ€™s move to create a Bitcoin reserve is unprecedented. As
opposed to other asset reserves like gold, this strategic reserve is made up entirely of Bitcoin obtained from criminal operations. With a projected
200,000 BTC already on its books, the U.S. is now one of the worldâ€™s biggest Bitcoin owners. Crypto experts contend that this move lowers
regulatory risk, legitimizes Bitcoin, and indicates a new direction for how governments think about digital assets. While some investors are
concerned, the bigger picture might actually influence the future of Bitcoin and international financial systems. Why Trumpâ€™s Bitcoin Reserve Is
a Bullish Signal A Lower Risk of a Bitcoin Ban: Regulatory uncertainty has long been a concern for Bitcoin investors. However, with the U.S. now
holding Bitcoin in its strategic reserves, a blanket ban is highly unlikely, providing greater security for investors and institutions. Accelerating Global
Bitcoin Adoption: As a financial powerhouse, the U.S. embracing Bitcoin could inspire other nations to follow suit. Countries that were hesitant
may now build their own reserves, fueling global adoption and solidifying Bitcoinâ€™s role in international finance. Strengthening Institutional
Legitimacy: With U.S. government recognition, mainstream financial institutions can no longer dismiss Bitcoin. This shift could drive adoption
among pension funds, wealth managers, and major financial players. No Cost to Taxpayers: Unlike traditional reserve assets, the U.S. Bitcoin
holdings come from seized funds, not taxpayer money. This ensures a strategic advantage without causing inflation or economic instability.
Bitcoinâ€™s Future in Finance: With government backing, growing adoption, and institutional acceptance, Bitcoin is securing its place as a key
player in the future of global finance. Trumpâ€™s plan for Bitcoin has generated controversy regarding the positioning of digital assets within the
global economy. Some think that as governments hold more Bitcoin, its scarcity will push prices up and will be beneficial for long-term holders.
Others think that government access to Bitcoin reserves can create regulatory headaches for the future. Bitcoin is no longer an outsider asset:
Despite various opinions, there is one fact: Bitcoin is no longer an outsider asset. With the U.S. government officially possessing BTC, its
reputation as a store of value has been strengthened. If other countries continue this trend, Bitcoinâ€™s reputation as â€œdigital goldâ€​ will
become even stronger. Trumpâ€™s Bitcoin reserve constitutes a significant change in the way governments view cryptocurrency. Although the
short-term market response was ambiguous, the long-term consequences might be transformational for Bitcoin and the wider crypto environment.
With America now at the forefront as a major Bitcoin owner, institutional acceptance will probably increase at an accelerated pace, and there may
be increased global adoption. Whether this action will usher in a new financial age or bring unexpected problems is yet to be determined but this is
one thing: Bitcoin is here to stay.
The crypto world is buzzing with excitement as meme coins continue to capture the imagination of investors and enthusiasts alike. Recent
developments have only added fuel to the fire. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently declared that meme coins are akin
to collectibles rather than securities, providing clarity and potentially paving the way for more mainstream acceptance. At the same time, the market
has witnessed a surge in meme coin activity, with new entrants making significant waves. Among these emerging stars is Arctic Pablo Coin, a
meme coin that stands out for its financial prospects and adventurous narrative. Arctic Pablo Coin invites investors on a mystical journey across
uncharted territories, blending the allure of hidden mysteries with the potential for substantial returns. Each phase of its presale is tied to unique
locations and stories, creating a rich tapestry that bridges the gap between myth and reality. Arctic Pablo Coin: Embark on a Mystical Journey with
High ROI Potential Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) isnâ€™t just another meme coin; itâ€™s an invitation to join an epic adventure led by the intrepid
explorer, Arctic Pablo. This coin weaves a narrative that takes investors through uncharted icy realms, each presale phase representing a new
location filled with hidden treasures and stories. Unlike traditional presales divided into stages, Arctic Pablo Coinâ€™s presale is segmented by
locations, each symbolizing a new chapter in Pabloâ€™s journey. As of now, Arctic Pablo has reached ChillVille, the 13th phase of its expedition.
The current price per APC token is $0.000070, with over $1.77 million raised so far. The launch price is set at $0.008, offering early investors a
staggering ROI potential of over 11,285.71% from this stage to the listing price. Investors can participate in a staking program offering a 66%
Annual Percentage Yield (APY). Holders can enjoy generous rewards by staking APC tokens while contributing to the networkâ€™s security
and stability. All staked coins will be vested for two months from the launch date, encouraging long-term commitment. It is one of the best new
meme coins to buy this week. Turn $500 into $714,063? Arctic Pabloâ€™s Insane Growth Potential! Crypto analysts predict Arctic Pablo Coin
could surge to $0.1 post-listing, and the numbers are staggering. At todayâ€™s presale price of $0.00007, a $500 investment secures 7,140,635
APC tokens. Once APC lists at $0.008, that turns into $57,125â€”but if it reaches $0.1? That same $500 could skyrocket to an unbelievable
$714,063! With each presale phase selling out fast, prices are rising. History shows meme coin presales can create millionaires overnightâ€”is

- The White House announced a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve via an executive order. - A new U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile will manage other
cryptocurrencies. The White House has confirmed the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a move outlined in an executive order signed by
President Donald Trump. This initiative comes just one day before the administrationâ€™s first-ever crypto summit. The order directs the Treasury
Department to establish an office managing the reserve, which will hold Bitcoin (BTC) confiscated through criminal or civil asset forfeiture. The
U.S. government currently possesses around 198,109 BTC, valued at approximately $16.92 billion. However, past Bitcoin sales resulted in an
estimated $16.14 billion loss due to premature liquidations. Trumpâ€™s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Trumpâ€™s executive order also establishes a
U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile to manage other cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin will be held indefinitely, different assets may be used for law
enforcement operations or returned to crime victims. The Treasury Department must submit a full accounting of all government-held digital assets
within 30 days. Trumpâ€™s support for crypto contrasts sharply with former President Joe Bidenâ€™s regulatory crackdowns. His
administration actively engages with the crypto industry, appointing David Sacks as the White House czar for AI and cryptocurrency. Sacks stated
that the governmentâ€™s Bitcoin holdings exceed 200,000 BTC, currently worth around $17.5 billion. On Sunday, Trump revealed plans to
expand digital asset reserves, including Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Cardano. His announcement sparked mixed reactions within the industry, with
some questioning the moveâ€™s long-term impact. Critics argue that a government-held Bitcoin reserve could destabilize the market. Law
professor Hilary Allen previously warned that selling large amounts of BTC could cause price crashes, undermining the assetâ€™s value. The
White Houseâ€™s crypto summit will gather industry leaders to discuss regulations and policy directions. Highlighted Crypto News Today Bitcoin
Slides to $87K Despite Crypto Summit and Strategic Reserve Execution
- Bitcoin has factored a modest price dip of 4.89% in the last 24 hours. - The cryptocurrencyâ€™ daily trading volume has surged by 14.99% as
per CMC data. The digital assets community is eagerly anticipating the White House Crypto Summit. The overall market cap has shown a modest
increase, as depicted by its 4.18% upward momentum. However, the largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has shown modest price drops yet again this
week. Notably, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order approving a national Bitcoin Strategic Reserve in the past day. This marks
a crucial milestone in crypto history and US history. On the other hand, the digital assetâ€™s downward movement despite this advancement has
raised speculations. On its daily price chart, Bitcoin shows a 4.89% drop over the last 24 hours. In the morning hours of March 6, the
cryptocurrency was trading at a high of $92,804. However, as bearish signs took over, BTC slid to the $87,000 range. At the time of writing, the
digital asset was trading at $88,148 as per CMC data. Zooming out, to its weekly trading history, Bitcoin shows bullish trends. Despite
fluctuations, it has managed to depict a 10% surge from the Monday market crash. Traversing from a 5-month low of $78,258 it also tested a high
of $95,043 during the span of the last 5 days. Will Bitcoin Fall Further Before A Rebound? On analyzing its recent price actions, Bitcoin traces a
horizontal pattern. This suggests that the token is entering a consolidation phase. The consolidation range stands between $83K â€“ $95K. The
horizontal channel indicates that it could either be followed by a price descent or a breakout. Secondly, its Moving Average Convergence
Divergence (MACD) signal line recently crossed over the MACD line entering a negative environment. This shows that Bitcoin still holds the
potential to turn bullish. Additionally, its RSI value stands at 43.33 suggesting an oversold market situation as per TradingView data. Meanwhile,
other altcoins such as XRP and Tron have shown modest price decreases in the last 24 hours.
- The White House Crypto Summit could trigger a â€œsell-the-newsâ€​ event. - Bitcoin price support levels are at $87,200 and $82,908, with
potential declines to $70,000. - The $92,000 short-term holder cost basis is key for determining momentum. Bitcoinâ€™s recent breakout of the
$90,000 support level has increased fears of a potential liquidity grab under this crucial price zone. On March 6, Bitcoin (BTC) hit a high of
$92,700, which represented a 19% rise from the February 28 low of $78,200. The price rise fuelled optimism in the market. Bitcoinâ€™s
subsequent rejection at $94,500, however, has opened the door to the possibility of a further decline in the coming days. The White House Crypto
Summitâ€™s Impact Everyone waits with bated breath for the March 7 White House Crypto Summit. Ahead of a pro-crypto position from the
U.S. government, there lies a possibility of bullish sentiment pushing prices upwards. Yet, there also remains a risk of a â€œsell-the-newsâ€​
situation if the summitsâ€™ results fall short of market expectations. The summit, to be hosted by U.S. President Donald Trump, seeks to unite
industry leaders to address important matters like regulatory policies, stablecoin regulation, and the place of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. financial
system. Some of the prominent guests will be names such as Michael Saylor, Strategy founder, Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple CEO, and Brian
Armstrong, Coinbase CEO. Although the Trump administration has been friendly to the crypto space, the results of the summit are far from certain.
Any overbearing regulatory actions, like strict KYC regulations or taxing unrealized gains, might have the potential to spook investors. Past
crashes, such as the 2022 crash after Bidenâ€™s SEC crackdowns, demonstrate Bitcoinâ€™s vulnerability to policy changes. If the summit
doesnâ€™t provide the expected regulatory clarity or adds unforeseen compliance requirements, Bitcoinâ€™s price could drop sharply by 20-
30%, as seen in previous patterns. Such was the case after Trumpâ€™s release of a Strategic Crypto Reserve, where Bitcoin first jumped but
eventually fell 15% from $95,150 to $81,483. Important Bitcoin Price Levels On March 6, Bitcoin briefly touched $92,000 before pulling back.
Traders are now focusing on crucial support levels, especially in the range below $90,000, as Bitcoin may revisit these levels soon. The key initial
support area is at $87,200, then comes the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) level at $82,908. Below these prices, Bitcoin might aim for the
cluster of liquidity in the zone of $81,463-$78,200, which had developed in early March and February, respectively. In case of a breakdown past
the $90,000 level of support, these levels can prove to be the crucial areas, and an extension of losses may have Bitcoin challenging the band
between $74,500-$75,800, with further extension towards the $70,000 level. Conversely, Bitcoin is resisting at $92,000 and $97,400, where the
50-day and 100-day SMAs meet. Breaking through this resistance area would mark the termination of the current downtrend and potentially drive
Bitcoin to new highs, with $100,000 and above in the sights. The STH cost basis of $92,000 is still a level to watch. Glassnode analysts have
pointed out that this level has been important in the past during bull market uptrends. If the market continues to fall, the $71,000 area is an
important area to watch. The active realized price at $70,000 also coincides with the lower band of the STH cost basis, making the $70,000 level
an important support area. Though Bitcoin demonstrated strength and hope after recent price fluctuations, these major factors like the White
House Crypto Summit and future regulatory changes may actually decide the short-term path of the market. Highlighted Crypto News Today
Michael Saylor Advocates for a U.S. Bitcoin Reserve at White House Crypto Summit
- Michael Saylor sees the Crypto Summit as key to making Bitcoin the U.S. reserve asset. - Industry leaders at the Crypto Summit will discuss
regulations and crypto adoption. - The Crypto Summit aims to shape a clear framework for a U.S. Bitcoin reserve. Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy
executive chairman, once again underlined the role of Bitcoin as the basis of a U.S. strategic crypto reserve. Ahead of the soon to be held White
House Crypto Summit. Saylor reiterated that Bitcoin is the sole digital asset upon which all can agree, without an issuer. And hence best suited for
national reserves. It will be hosted by President Donald Trump and chaired by White House crypto czar David Sacks. And will gather leading
industry players such as Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek, and Kraken CEO Arjun Sethi. The topics will cover
the framework, funding, and regulation for the envisioned U.S. crypto reserve. Why the U.S. Needs a Bitcoin Reserve? Saylor emphasized the
necessity of a strategic and open method of accumulating Bitcoin. This cites the Alumnus Bill, which suggests the purchase of one million BTC
within four years. He is of the opinion that by locking up Bitcoin early, the U.S. can dominate the digital economy before other countries. Although
Trump initially proposed to include altcoins such as XRP, Solana, and Cardano in the reserve. Thus, industry opposition resulted in a clarification
that Bitcoin and Ethereum would be its main assets. Saylor, however, insists that Bitcoin must be the focus, as it is a digital commodity with no
central issuer. Critics have raised the question of whether a Bitcoin reserve is needed, likening it to conventional strategic reserves such as oil or
weapons. Saylor responded by framing Bitcoin as the â€œproperty of cyberspaceâ€​ and a vital asset in ensuring U.S. financial leadership. With
the changing regulatory environment, Saylor encouraged the administration to have well-defined digital asset rules in place before large-scale
buying. He emphasized that whatever acquisition is done, it has to be done â€œdeliberately, progressively, and transparently.â€​ Highlighted Crypto

Key Highlights: - House Bill 302 moves to a full House vote after a 16-1 approval. - Bitcoin allocation was reduced from 10% to 5% for secure
management. - New Hampshire could join Texas, North Carolina, and Oklahoma in Bitcoin reserves. New Hampshire is progressing towards
adopting Bitcoin to its state reserves portfolio through a legislative bill proposed by Representative Keith Ammon. The House Commerce and
Affairs Committee strongly backed House Bill 302, enabling state treasury investment in Bitcoin and precious metals before the bill gained a 16-1
vote of approval. Following approval by committees, the bill will advance for consideration by the full House membership. This milestone
demonstrates New Hampshireâ€™s accelerating move towards adopting crypto methods. The approval of this bill would make New Hampshire
part of the states that use Bitcoin as a reserve asset along with Texas, North Carolina, and Oklahoma. Government institutions across the nation
continue to adopt cryptocurrency as an essential part of their financial systems through localized strategies. New Hampshire Bitcoin Bill Limits
Allocation to 5% for Security The initial proposal of House Bill 302 sought the utilization of 10% from New Hampshireâ€™s general fund to
purchase Bitcoin before the lawmakers revised the amount to 5%. A more careful approach to digital asset management led to the reduction of the
proposed Bitcoin investment from 10% to 5% under New Hampshire House Bill 302. The state is mandated through this bill to work with licensed
custodial experts who ensure secure asset protection against security threats. The new legislation bases its approach on global concerns about
digital asset storage alongside regulatory oversight as governments examine cryptocurrency as a financial reserve. Growing Interest in Bitcoin as a
Reserve Asset The state of New Hampshire stands among numerous governments worldwide which adopted Bitcoin solutions in this current
period. Brazil together with Poland, alongside various other countries started exploring to put cryptocurrency in national reserves. The Bitcoin
acquisition strategy brought forth by El Salvador serves as an exemplary approach for public institutions to invest in digital assets. A New
Hampshire House decision in the near future will decide whether the state will add Bitcoin to its treasury assets officially. The successful passing of
this legislation would place New Hampshire at the forefront of U.S. states that maintain Bitcoin in their fiscal reserves. Highlighted Crypto News

- Trumpâ€™s crypto reserve is likely to be â€œnearly entirely Bitcoin,â€​ says Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan. - Some industry leaders are not happy
with the inclusion of small-cap cryptocurrencies in US reserves. Bitwiseâ€™s Chief Investment Officer, Matt Hougan, shared his view on
Trumpâ€™s US crypto reserve. Despite initial plans to include various altcoins, Donald Trumpâ€™s proposed cryptocurrency reserve will likely
end up being almost exclusively Bitcoin, according to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan. Hougan highlights that the marketâ€™s initial negative reaction to
the inclusion of smaller cryptos misses the bigger picture of what could become a significant government investment in digital assets. He predicts
that when everything is finalized, Bitcoin will dominate the US reserve. Market Confusion Over Reserve Composition In a March 5 blog post,
Hougan stated that including small-cap cryptocurrencies in US reserves unnecessarily complicated matters. On Sunday, March 2, Trump
announced that the reserve would include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Cardano. Initially, the market spiked on the news, with Bitcoin
jumping from $85,000 to $95,000. But on the next day, the market started to pare back and ate almost all their announcement gains. This was
partly due to Trump delaying auto parts tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Some industry leaders questioned the inclusion of smaller cryptocurrencies
of what they consider speculative assets. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong argued that only Bitcoin, as â€œa successor to gold,â€​ should be
included in such a reserve. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has suggested that Bitcoin might receive special status in the reserve while
â€œother crypto tokens will be treated differently â€” positively, but differently.â€​ Hougan believes the final composition will evolve following input
from industry leaders at the upcoming White House crypto summit. He predicts that â€œdespite the flawed rollout,â€​ the reserve will ultimately
prove bullish for crypto markets, particularly Bitcoin. Highlighted Crypto News Today: Monthly Market Insights Report by Binance Research

solutions. While XRP and Bitcoin dominate the headlines, Qubetics is quietly gaining momentum, with its presale already raising millions. Could this
be the most overlooked crypto opportunity of 2025? QubeQode IDE: The Future of Blockchain Development Imagine trying to build a website
from scratch without templates or coding shortcutsâ€”sounds like a nightmare, right? Thatâ€™s exactly how most blockchain development has
been. Qubetics is changing that with its QubeQode IDE, a visual development environment designed to make blockchain programming as easy as
drag-and-drop. For businesses, this is a game-changer. Companies looking to integrate blockchain for secure payments, supply chain tracking, or
decentralized identity management no longer need an army of developers. With pre-built blockchain components for authentication, token
management, and data storage, even those with minimal coding experience can build decentralized applications. Even independent developers
benefit from the form-based smart contract configuration, allowing them to define application logic without intricate code editing. QubeQodeâ€™s
code snippet library further simplifies the process, offering pre-written solutions for common blockchain tasks. By making blockchain more
accessible, Qubetics is positioning itself as a best crypto investment for those betting on mass adoption. Qubetics Presale: The Window for High
ROI Is Closing With crypto enthusiasts constantly hunting for the best crypto investment, Qubetics ($TICS) has become a hot topic. Currently in
its 24th presale stage, it has already raised $14.6 million, with over 22,200 holders and 495 million $TICS tokens sold. Right now, the price is
$0.0976, but this will increase by 10% this Sunday at 12 AM when the next stage begins. The potential returns are turning heads. If $TICS
reaches $0.25 by the end of the presale, early buyers could see a 155.93% ROI. But the real excitement lies in long-term projectionsâ€”if $TICS
hits $10 post-mainnet launch, that translates into a 10,137.16% ROI. To put that into perspective, a $750 investment today would be worth
$7,680 at $1 per TICS and a staggering $115,200 at $15 per TICS. With the best crypto presale nearing its final stages, those looking for early
entry pricing wonâ€™t have much time left. XRP: Regulatory Battles Shake Up Market Sentiment XRP is once again at the center of crypto
volatility, with market reactions driven by speculation surrounding the SEC appeal and discussions about crypto reserves. Recent movements
indicate that XRP remains highly reactive to regulatory developments, with sentiment shifting rapidly. Currently, XRP traders are watching for
signals that could influence price momentum. The SEC appeal has added uncertainty, but if a favorable ruling emerges, XRP could see significant
upward movement. Meanwhile, talks about including XRP in potential crypto reserve discussions have further fueled speculation. With regulatory
clarity still in limbo, XRP remains a high-risk, high-reward play. Traders looking for the best crypto investment must weigh the potential upside
against the legal uncertainties that continue to impact XRPâ€™s trajectory. Bitcoin: U.S. Crypto Reserve Discussions Spark Debate Bitcoinâ€™s
role as a financial powerhouse just took another twist, with Coinbase and Geminiâ€™s CEOs advocating for BTC as the U.S. crypto reserve.
The idea? A Bitcoin-only reserve system to strengthen economic resilience, particularly as global financial policies evolve. This discussion has
stirred market excitement, especially as Bitcoin continues to trade at elevated levels. If policymakers take this proposal seriously, it could trigger
massive institutional adoption, reinforcing Bitcoinâ€™s status as the ultimate best crypto investment. However, the road to a Bitcoin-backed
reserve isnâ€™t straightforward. Regulatory hurdles and opposition from traditional financial institutions pose significant challenges. But if Bitcoin
maintains its momentum and secures further institutional backing, its long-term dominance seems undeniable. Conclusion: Which Crypto Stands
Out the Most? Qubetics, XRP, and Bitcoin each present compelling opportunities. XRP is navigating high-stakes legal battles that could define its
future, Bitcoin is making headlines with discussions about becoming a U.S. crypto reserve, and Qubetics is revolutionizing blockchain accessibility
while offering one of the best crypto investment opportunities through its high-demand presale. As the crypto presale window closes, those looking
for maximum upside potential may want to join this crypto presale before the next price jump. For More Information: - Qubetics:

investment? Qubetics is solving blockchain complexity with its drag-and-drop IDE, making smart contract development more accessible. Its
presale success signals strong demand and future growth. How is Bitcoinâ€™s potential as a U.S. crypto reserve impacting its value? Discussions
about Bitcoin becoming a U.S. reserve asset have fueled institutional interest. If adopted, it could solidify Bitcoinâ€™s position as a dominant
financial asset. Whatâ€™s next for XRP amid the SEC appeal? XRPâ€™s price remains tied to regulatory developments. If the SEC appeal is
resolved favorably, XRP could experience significant upward movement. Disclaimer: TheNewsCrypto does not endorse any content on this page.

jumped more than 20% today after the firm announced its latest purchase of 497 Bitcoins. Japanâ€™s firm has been circling around the media for
its relentless BTC purchase since last year. Despite the market price swings triggered by Trumpâ€™s tariffs and crypto announcements,
Metaplanet remains committed to BTC purchase. Metaplanet stock price has been going on a downtrend for the past few weeks. However, it
witnessed a more than 20% surge today following the announcement of the BTC purchase. One Meta planet share price is currently valued at
4,045 JPY, which was close to 3,400 JPY earlier today. *Metaplanet Purchases Additional 497 $BTC* pic.twitter.com/HActZWEduo â€”
Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) March 5, 2025 Meta planet revealed its latest Bitcoin purchase on its official X account. CEO Simon
Gerovich also confirmed the purchase, stating that the firm spent $43.9 million and acquired 497 BTC. The average price of Bitcoin in this
purchase is approximately $88,448. Metaplanet Continues its BTC Purchase to Achieve 10,000 BTC by 2025 Metaplanet achieved a year-to-
date BTC yield of 45.1% in 2025. So far, the Japan-based firm has acquired 2888 BTC for $240.2 million at an average BTC price of $83,172.
Whales and major global firms such as Strategy are taking advantage of the present market dips and accumulating Bitcoins. The firm reached a
total 0.01% of BTC supply by the end of February after purchasing 68 Bitcoins. It revealed ambitious goals of acquiring 10,000 BTC by the end
of 2025 and 21,000 Bitcoins by the end of 2026. Metaplanet acquired 156 Bitcoin in its earlier purchase a couple of days ago. Bitcoin is currently
trading at $88,463 with a slight recovery of 5.68% in the last 24 hours. After Trumpâ€™s announcement regarding crypto reserve hype faded off,
the crypto market lost over 10% market cap. Meanwhile, Trumpâ€™s new tariffs will also adversely impact the market. However, Bitcoin and
altcoins are showing signs of recovery today. Highlighted Crypto News Today: El Salvador Refuses to Halt Bitcoin Accumulation Under IMF
Deal
- From 2020 to 2024, Ricardo Salinas raised his Bitcoin investments from 10% to 70% stake. - Mexicoâ€™s banking authority slowed down the
implementation of Bitcoin into Banco Aztecaâ€™s operations. - Metaplanet and El Salvador buy more Bitcoin signaling global adoption. Mexican
billionaire Ricardo Salinas has allocated 70% of his total investment portfolio to Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related assets. During his March 4 Bloomberg
interview, the founder and chairman of Grupo Salinas discussed his current investment strategy. During 2020 Salinas maintained Bitcoin as 10% of
his portfolio, but he increased his holdings in 2022. The number of bitcoin Salinas owned grew to 60% in April 2022. Now, he is â€œpretty much
all inâ€​ on Bitcoin, with the remaining 30% of his portfolio distributed to gold and gold miners. The businessman emphasized Bitcoinâ€™s fixed
supply, calling it the â€œhardest asset in the world.â€​ He also recommended a long-term approach, suggesting investors buy Bitcoin gradually
through dollar-cost averaging. Salinas Pushes for Bitcoin Despite Regulatory Challenges Salinas has consistently supported the integration of
Bitcoin into Mexicoâ€™s financial infrastructure for many years. In 2021 he directed Banco Azteca towards becoming the initial financial
institution in Mexico to welcome Bitcoin transactions through Grupo Salinas. However, the requested initiative met resistance from regulatory
authorities which caused a delay. Salinas maintains his dedication to implementing Bitcoin adoption processes. He revealed his intention to split the
financial services and retail company Grupo Elektra from Grupo Salinas. The division would permit him to oversee Grupo Elektra as an
independent entity. Salinas, with a net worth of $4.6 billion, has long expressed concerns about traditional financial systems. Bitcoin received
strong endorsement from Salina who invested most of his wealth into this decentralized form of currency. He stated officially that all his investments
are limited to the assets within his businesses. Bitcoin Holdings Surge Among Corporations and Governments Salinas is not the only major entity
increasing Bitcoin exposure Metaplanet recently acquired 135 Bitcoin for $13 million at an average price of $96,185 per BTC, making it the 14th
largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally. Meanwhile, El Salvador expanded its Bitcoin reserves by purchasing seven Bitcoin on February 24,
surpassing its usual daily average of one. The countryâ€™s National Bitcoin Office highlighted this increase as part of its broader Bitcoin strategy.
The rising number of institutions that invest in Bitcoin demonstrates a worldwide movement in investment patterns. The financial role of Bitcoin
grows stronger because more corporations and governments buy Bitcoin. Highlighted Crypto for Today Highlighted Crypto News Today:
- Bukele insists Bitcoin accumulation will continue despite IMF restrictions. - El Salvador added 1 BTC to its reserves on March 4, holding 6,101
BTC. El Salvadorâ€™s President Nayib Bukele has reaffirmed that the country will continue accumulating Bitcoin (BTC), despite the recent
International Monetary Fundâ€™s (IMF) agreement suggesting otherwise. Bukele dismissed claims that El Salvadorâ€™s Bitcoin strategy would
stop, countering the IMFâ€™s requirements tied to a $1.4 billion loan deal. The IMF recently released a report stating that the Salvadoran
government should halt voluntary Bitcoin purchases. The agreement imposes restrictions on Bitcoin acquisitions, mining, and transactions. It also
requires the government to disclose its Bitcoin wallet addresses and liquidate its Fidebitcoin trust fund by July 2025. Bukele responded by posting
on X, rejecting the IMFâ€™s stance. He stated, â€œThis all stops in April.â€™ â€˜This all stops in June.â€™ â€˜This all stops in
December.â€™ No, itâ€™s not stopping.â€​ The post came after El Salvador added another Bitcoin to its national reserves on March 4, bringing
the total to 6,101 BTC, worth over $530 million. IMF Conditions and El Salvadorâ€™s Bitcoin Holdings The IMF agreement enforces strict
limitations on Bitcoin activities. It mandates a â€œceiling of 0â€​ on government Bitcoin purchases and prohibits further involvement in Bitcoin-
related economic activities. The IMF emphasized that compliance is crucial for receiving continued funding. Despite these conditions, El Salvador
remains committed to its accumulation strategy. The Bitcoin Office disclosed the purchase of 19 BTC in the past week, followed by another
acquisition on Tuesday. The countryâ€™s Bitcoin reserve continues growing, despite the IMFâ€™s restrictions. Bukeleâ€™s stance has received
backing from Bitcoin supporters. Strategy chairman Michael Saylor posted, â€œBitcoin adoption is unstoppable.â€​ Samson Mow also
commented on the IMFâ€™s restrictions, questioning how they will impact El Salvadorâ€™s future purchases. El Salvadorâ€™s Bitcoin strategy
began in 2021 when the country made BTC legal tender. Bukele announced in 2022 that the government would buy one Bitcoin daily. Highlighted
Crypto News Today Is the Next Big Breakout for AAVE Around the Corner After a 21% Jump?
- Bitcoin has factored in a modest price increase of 3.42% in the last 24 hours. - The cryptocurrency shows a 23.30% dip in daily trading volume
as per CMC data. The Asian crypto community has awakened to a modest market revival after the past dayâ€™s significant crash. Leading
cryptocurrencies have witnessed partial gains despite market uncertainty and a lack of bullish momentum. However, the upcoming days hold
mounting tensions and more FUD due to shifting economic landscapes. Notably, Bitcoin has gained a modest 3.42% in the last 24 hours, rising to
the $86K range. Moreover, the cryptocurrency also hit an intra-day high of $88,911 a few hours ago. In the morning hours of March 4, the
cryptocurrency was trading at a low of $83,314, after which it progressed to its current range. Further corroborating this price movement, certain
analysts have predicted a rebound in Bitcoin based on chart patterns. Prominent market expert, Ali (@ali_charts) stated that when trader loss
margins reach -12% a BTC rebound occurs as per historical data. The current loss margin is at -15.4% which could trigger a reversal. At the time
of writing, BTC was trading at $87,156 as per CMC data. #Bitcoin $BTC has historically rebounded when the trader loss margin reaches -12%.

global economic landscape is turning rocky amid mounting tensions between nations. Donald Trumpâ€™s increased tariffs have affected global
trade and a recent development has added to complications. Will the Global Economic Dispute Act Bitcoin Bull Run Barrier? In the past few
hours, news of Donald Trumpâ€™s increasing tariffs for India, South Korea, and China. This has further instigated shifts in global trade
relationships. Moreover, the last two market crashes resulted from the US presidentâ€™s announcement of tariff hikes. This suggests that the
external factor might impose barriers to Bitcoin reinstating its bull run. Moreover, analyzing its technical indicators, the cryptocurrencyâ€™s bull
power indicator stands at 1.61. However, its bear power indicator value stands at -4.09 suggesting bearish control. Furthermore, Bitcoinâ€™s
RSI value stands at 40.96 as per TradingView data. This further highlights that the digital asset is currently residing in the oversold region.
Meanwhile, other altcoins such as XRP and Solana have also shown price recovery.
- The global crypto market cap dropped 8.76% to $2.77T. - Bitcoin (BTC) is below its 50-day moving average, confirming a bearish trend. The
global crypto market is facing a sharp downturn, with the total market cap falling to $2.77 trillion, an 8.76% drop in the last 24 hours. Market
trading volume has also decreased by 15.59% to $176.55 billion, indicating reduced investor activity. The entire crypto market is bearish, pulling
Bitcoin (BTC) down significantly. Bitcoin is currently trading at $83,093.80, down 9.43% in the last 24 hours. Its market cap has fallen to $1.66
trillion, reflecting a 9.24% decline. The 24-hour trading volume stands at $73.6 billion, showing a slight drop of 1.08%. Bearish Indicators For
BTC Bitcoin is facing strong resistance at $86,800. If bulls push the price above this level, BTC could rally toward $90,000 in the short term.
However, failure to break resistance could trigger another sell-off. The first major support level is $82,500. If Bitcoin fails to hold this level, the
next key support sits at $80,000. A break below this mark could accelerate selling pressure, pushing the price lower. The Relative Strength Index
(RSI) is currently at 36.45, indicating oversold conditions. The RSI average is slightly higher at 37.86, suggesting weak momentum. A move above
40 could signal a potential price reversal, but continued downward movement would confirm bearish strength. The CMF (20) stands at 0.02,
indicating weak buying pressure. A drop below 0 would confirm increased outflows and lower investor confidence. Bitcoin is currently trading
below its 50-day moving average (MA), confirming a bearish trend. The 200-day MA remains a critical resistance level. A bullish crossover,
where the 50-day MA moves above the 200-day MA, could signal a trend reversal. However, until BTC reclaims key resistance levels, the
market remains bearish. Bitcoin needs to reclaim $86,800 to shift momentum in favor of bulls. If BTC drops below $82,500, it could slide toward
$80,000 or lower. Until buying pressure increases, Bitcoin is likely to remain in a bearish phase. Highlighted Crypto News Today GoPlus Security

The Sonic blockchain is working on the implementation of its yield-generating, algorithmic stablecoin despite fears over a potential collapse similar to the Terra-Luna meltdown that led to the industryâ€™s longest crypto winter. Algorithmic stablecoins employ code-based mechanisms to ensure their price stability, as opposed to fiat stablecoins pegged directly to the value of the underlying currency. The Sonic blockchain is working on the implementation of an algorithmic
stablecoin with up to 23% annual percentage rate (APR), according to Andre Cronje, co-founder of Sonic Labs and founder of Yearn.finance. Cronje wrote in a March 22 X post: Source: Andre Cronje The announcement came a day after Cronje admitted to experiencing Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to algorithmic stablecoin due to previous cycles: In May 2022, the $40 billion Terra ecosystem collapsed, erasing tens of billions of dollars of value in a matter of days.
Terraâ€™s algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST), was yielding an over 20% annual percentage yield (APY) on Anchor Protocol.Â Â Â As UST lost its dollar peg, crashing to a low of around $0.30, Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon took to X to share his rescue plan. At the same time, the value of sister token LUNA, once a top-10 crypto project by market capitalization, plunged over 98% to $0.84. For reference: LUNA was trading north of $120 in early April.

Chip-making giant Nvidiaâ€™s (NVDA) stock is flashing a major bearish signal â€” the last time this pattern appeared, it retraced nearly 50%. This may raise questions for the AI crypto sector, which has, at times, seemed to react to Nvidiaâ€™s price. â€œNVDA just formed a Death Cross for the first time since April 2022.

A crypto analyst says inaccurate narratives still circulate in the cryptocurrency market, mainly based on skewed information rather than onchain data to back it up. â€œBeware of misinformation. Despite the data, misleading narratives persist,â€(cid:157) CryptoQuant contributor â€œOnchained,â€(cid:157) said in a March 22 market report. â€œSuch claims often lack onchain validation and are driven by sensationalist market sentiment rather than objective analysis,â€(cid:157) the analyst said, adding:
Onchained pointed to the recent movements of Bitcoin (BTC) long-term holders (LTH) â€” those holding for over 155 days â€” as an example of false narratives clashing with real data. The analyst pointed out that while some narratives claim Bitcoin long-term holders are â€œcapitulating,â€(cid:157) the data shows theyâ€™re remaining consistent. â€œThe data leaves no room for speculation,â€(cid:157) Onchained said. The Inactive Supply Shift Index (ISSI) â€” which measures the degree to

Cryptocurrency wallet providers are getting more sophisticated, but so are bad actors â€” which means the battle between security and threats is at a deadlock, says a hardware wallet firm executive. â€œIt will always be a cat and mouse game,â€(cid:157) Ledger chief experience officer Ian Rogers told Cointelegraph when describing the constant race between crypto wallet firms adding new security features and hackers finding more advanced ways to access victimsâ€™ wallets.

scammers are always asking you for your 24 words,â€(cid:157) Rogers said. CertiK chief business officer Jason Jiang recently told Cointelegraph that being aware of phishing attacks on social media can drastically increase a userâ€™s crypto security. Sometimes, scammers hijack the accounts of well-known industry figures to post malicious links, making it even harder for users to spot the scam.

US President Donald Trump wants to make his country a â€œBitcoin superpower,â€(cid:157) but the question remains as to who he is competing against.Â Speaking at Blockworkâ€™s Digital Asset Summit on March 20 to a crowd of crypto industry executives and observers, he said, â€œTogether we will make America the undisputed Bitcoin (BTC) superpower and the crypto capital of the world.â€(cid:157) The US crypto industry has benefited greatly from preferential executive orders coming
out of Trumpâ€™s White House, including the establishment of a â€œstrategic Bitcoin reserveâ€(cid:157) â€” a move advocates regard as a key metric for Bitcoin adoption. However, many other countries, including major US trade partners, are just not ready to take on Bitcoin as a reserve asset, begging the question of who the US is competing against to become a â€œBitcoin superpower.â€(cid:157) Compared to major trade partners and geopolitical rivals, the US is certainly far ahead of the
game in terms of Bitcoin adoption. Neither the European Union, China, Mexico nor Canada have taken such drastic steps toward institutionalizing the asset. China, the USâ€™ largest trade partner by far and also its most prominent geopolitical opponent, has taken a strong stance against the asset, initially banning it outright before softening its approach slightly. China now allows mining operations but strictly prohibits the use of Bitcoin. Overall, the government has preferred to
concentrate its efforts on developing a retail central bank digital currency in the form of the digital yuan.Â The European Union, another major US trade partner, passed its Markets in Crypto-Assets regulatory framework in May 2023, which came into full implementation by member states at the end of 2024.Â While the EU is ahead of the US in terms of passing concrete legislation, it offers far less preferential terms to the industry than those expected in the USâ€™ parallel
legislation currently circulating in Congress. Crypto user penetration in the EU is expected to remain essentially stagnant this year, and cryptocurrencyâ€™s popularity is low overall among its wealthiest economies. No member state has a Bitcoin reserve. Even in crypto-friendly Switzerland, which saw $52.4 billion in US service exports in 2024, there are limits to crypto endorsement and adoption. On March 1, Swiss National Bank President Martin Schlegel said Bitcoin wasnâ€™t
suitable as a reserve asset, citing stability, liquidity concerns and security risks. Germanyâ€™s central bank chief, Joachim Nagel, has also dismissed the idea of a Bitcoin reserve, while Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has previously criticized Bitcoin as being a poor form of money.Â Related: What Canadaâ€™s new Liberal PM Mark Carney means for crypto South Korea doesnâ€™t feel ready to hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset, with the Bank of Korea stating that BTC is volatile
and does not meet International Monetary Fund standards.Â Russia, for its part, has allowed crypto to be used in international settlements to circumvent sanctions. The central bank is also preparing a three-year experiment to allow select investors to trade crypto. Some legal scholars in the country have suggested establishing a crypto fund consisting of assets seized in criminal proceedings, although the Duma has yet to form one. Critics have questioned the strategic value of the
US Bitcoin reserve and who it benefits in the long run.Â Cornell economics professor Eswar Prasad said, â€œThis is neither a strategic nor sensible idea but instead benefits bitcoin holders while sticking US taxpayers with the bill and exposing the government to financial risks. The US government would become a key driver of bitcoinâ€™s price on the way up and down.â€(cid:157) As noted by TLDR News, the point of most strategic reserves is to stock commodities that are deemed
critically important to the function of a countryâ€™s economy. Governments can also create them to stabilize the price of goods that are in high demand. The US has strategic reserves of oil and grain, while China even has a strategic pork stockpile.Â The Bitcoin strategic reserve does neither of these, as there is no great demand among Americans for Bitcoin, and Bitcoiners certainly donâ€™t want the price to remain stable.Â George Selgin, a senior fellow and director emeritus at
the Cato Instituteâ€™s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, said the reserveâ€™s stated goal of helping pay off US national debt was unrealistic. â€œThe planâ€™s million-coin stash would have to more than double in value during its 20-year holding period just to compensate for the planâ€™s implicit interest cost. Second, the stockpile must eventually be sold to realize the gains, and you can bet that the same bitcoin holders who have managed to get the government
to keep the bitcoin it already has will cry foul if it ever tries to sell any new coins it acquires,â€(cid:157) he stated. Claims of it serving as a digital Fort Knox are â€œjust as dubious,â€(cid:157) he said, as the gold contained therein hasnâ€™t propped up the value of the dollar since Richard Nixon was president and took the dollar off of the gold standard.Â Even Bitcoiners have taken a crack at the reserve. Charles Edwards, founder of Bitcoin and digital asset hedge fund Capriole Investments,
criticized the â€œhold onlyâ€(cid:157) policy of the reserve, calling it â€œdisappointingâ€(cid:157) and a â€œpig in lipstick.â€(cid:157) Source: Charles Edwards The reserve even proved to be something of a non-starter for Bitcoin price, with price action remaining relatively stable after Trump signed the executive order on March 6.Â As it stands, the US is leading a race that no one else is running. But things could change quickly. Right-wing parties sympathetic to the creation of Bitcoin reserves have
been on the rise in European elections.Â Brazil, a major economy in the Western hemisphere, has also been weighing the possibility of a Bitcoin reserve.Â Furthermore, the US Bitcoin reserve allows the Treasury to purchase Bitcoin so long as it can do so in a budget-neutral manner that doesnâ€™t come at a cost to taxpayers. The full effect of the reserve, and its influence on Bitcoin adoption, may yet be felt.Â Magazine: Memecoins are ded â€” But Solana â€˜100x betterâ€™

Once, long ago, cryptocurrency companies operated comfortably in the US. In that quaint, bygone era, they would often conduct funding events called â€œinitial coin offerings,â€(cid:157) and then use those raised funds to try to do things in the real and blockchain world. Now, they largely do this â€œoffshoreâ€(cid:157) through foreign entities while geofencing the United States. The effect of this change has been dramatic: Practically all major cryptocurrency issuers started in the US now
include some off-shore foundation arm. These entities create significant domestic challenges. They are expensive, difficult to operate, and leave many crucial questions about governance and regulation only half answered.Â Many in the industry yearn to â€œre-shore,â€(cid:157) but until this year, there has been no path to do so. Now, though, that could change. New crypto-rulemaking is on the horizon, members of the Trump family have floated the idea of eliminating capital gains tax
on cryptocurrency, and many US federal agencies have dropped enforcement actions against crypto firms. For the first time in four years, the government has signaled to the cryptocurrency industry that it is open to deal. There may soon be a path to return to the US. The story of US offshoring traces back to 2017. Crypto was still young, and the Securities and Exchange Commission had taken a hands-off approach to the regulation of these new products. That all changed when the
commission released a document called â€œThe DAO Report.â€(cid:157) For the first time, the SEC argued that the homebrew cryptocurrency tokens that had developed since the 2009 Bitcoin white paper were actually regulated instruments called securities. This prohibition was not total â€” around the same time as The DAO Reportâ€™s launch, SEC Director of Corporate Finance William Hinman publicly expressed his views that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) were not securities. To
clarify this distinction, the commission released a framework for digital assets in 2019, which identified relevant factors to evaluate a tokenâ€™s security status and noted that â€œthe stronger their presence, the less likely the Howey test is met.â€(cid:157) Relying on this guidance, many speculated that functional â€œconsumptiveâ€(cid:157) uses of tokens would insulate projects from securities concerns.Â In parallel, complicated tax implications were crystallizing. Tax advisers reached a
consensus that, unlike traditional financing instruments like simple agreements for future equity (SAFEs) or preferred equity, token sales were fully taxable events in the US. Simple agreements for future tokens (SAFTs) â€” contracts to issue future tokens â€” faced little better tax treatment, with the taxable event merely deferred until the tokens were released. This meant that a token sale by a US company would generate a massive tax liability. Related: Trade war puts
Bitcoinâ€™s status as safe-haven asset in doubt Projects tried in good faith to adhere to these guidelines. Lawyers extracted principles and advised clients to follow them. Some bit the bullet and paid the tax rather than contriving to create a foreign presence for a US project. All this chugged along for a few years. The SEC brought some major enforcement actions, like its moves against Ripple and Telegram, and shut down other projects, like Diem. But many founders still believed
they could operate legally in the US if they stuck to the script.Â Then, events conspired to knock this uneasy equilibrium out of balance. SEC Chair Gary Gensler entered the scene in 2021, Sam Bankman-Fried blew up FTX in 2022, and an unheralded opinion from Judge Paul Barbadoro came out of the sleepy US District Court for the District of New Hampshire in a case called SEC v. LBRY. The LBRY case is a small one, affecting what is, by all accounts, a minor crypto project, but the
application of law that came out of it had a dramatic effect on the practice of cryptocurrency law and, by extension, the avenues open to founders.Â Judge Barbadoro conceded that the token may have consumptive uses but held that â€œnothing in the case law suggests that a token with both consumptive and speculative uses cannot be sold as an investment contract.â€(cid:157) He went on to say that he could not â€œreject the SEC's contention that LBRY offered [the token] as a
security simply because some [token] purchases were made with consumptive intent.â€(cid:157) Because of the â€œeconomic realities,â€(cid:157) Barbadoro held that it did not matter if some â€œmay have acquired LBC in part for consumptive purposes.â€(cid:157)Â This was devastating. The holding in LBRY is, essentially, that the factors proposed in the SEC framework largely do not matter in actual securities disputes. In LBRY, Judge Barbadoro found that the consumptive uses may be present, but
the purchasersâ€™ expectation of profit predominated.Â And this, it turned out, meant that virtually any token offering might be considered a security. It meant that any evidence that a token was marketed as offering potential profit could be used against you. Even the supposition that it seemed likely that people bought it to profit could be fatal. This had a chilling effect. The LBRY case and related case law destabilized the cryptocurrency project landscape. Instead of a potential
framework to work within, there remained just a single vestige of hope to operate legally in the US: Move offshore and decentralize.Â Even the SEC admitted that Bitcoin and ETH were not securities because they were decentralized. Rather than having any promoter who could be responsible for their sale, they were the products of diffuse networks, attributable to no one. Projects in 2022 and 2023 were left with little option but to attempt to decentralize. Related: Ripple
celebrates SECâ€™s dropped appeal, but crypto rules still not set Inevitably, the operations would begin in the United States. A few developers would create a project in a small apartment. As they found success, they wanted to fundraise â€” and in crypto, when you fundraise, investors demand tokens. But itâ€™s illegal to sell tokens in the US.Â So, their VC or lawyer would advise them to establish a foundation in a more favorable jurisdiction, such as the Cayman Islands, Zug in
Switzerland, or Panama. That foundation could be set up to â€œwrapâ€(cid:157) a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which would have governance mechanisms tied to tokens. Through that entity or another offshore entity, they would either sell tokens under a Regulation S exemption from US securities law or simply give them away in an airdrop. In this way, projects hoped they could develop liquid markets and a sizable market cap, eventually achieving the
â€œdecentralizationâ€(cid:157) that might allow them to operate legally as an entity in the US again. Several crypto exchanges were incorporated in friendlier jurisdictions in 2023. Source: CoinGecko These offshore structures didnâ€™t just provide a compliance function â€” they also offered tax advantages. Because foundations have no owners, they arenâ€™t subject to the â€œcontrolled foreign corporationâ€(cid:157) rules, under which foreign corporations get indirectly taxed in the US
through their US shareholders.Â Well-advised foundations also ensured they engaged in no US business activities, preserving their â€œoffshoreâ€(cid:157) status. Presto: They became amazing tax vehicles, unburdened by direct US taxation because they operate exclusively offshore and are shielded from indirect US taxation because they are ownerless. Even better, this arrangement often gave them a veneer of legitimacy, making it difficult for regulators to pin down a single controlling
party. After the formation, the US enterprise would become a rump â€œlabsâ€(cid:157) or â€œdevelopmentâ€(cid:157) company that earned income through licensing software and IP to these new offshore entities â€” waiting for the day when everything would be different, checking the mail for Wells notices, and feeling a bit jumpy.Â So, it wasnâ€™t just regulation that drove crypto offshore â€” it was hope. A thousand projects wanted to find a way to operate legally in the United States, and
offshore decentralization was the only path.Â Now, that may change. With President Donald Trump in office, the hallways of 100 F Street in Washington, DC may just be thawing. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has taken the mantle and is leading the SECâ€™s Crypto Task Force. In recent weeks, Peirce has expressed interest in offering prospective and retroactive relief for token issuers and creating a regulatory third way where token launches are treated as â€œnon-
securitiesâ€(cid:157) through the SEC's Section 28 exemptive authority.Â At the same time, evolutions in law are beginning to open the door for onshore operations. David Kerr of Cowrie LLP and Miles Jennings of a16z have pioneered a new corporate form, the decentralized unincorporated nonprofit association (DUNA), that may allow autonomous organizations to function as legal entities in US states like Wyoming. Eric Trump has proposed favorable tax treatments for cryptocurrency
tokens, which, though it might be a stretch, could offer a massive draw to bring assets back onshore. And without waiting on any official shifts in regulation, tax attorneys have come up with more efficient fundraising approaches, such as token warrants, to help projects navigate the existing system. As a16z recently put it in a meeting with Commissioner Peirceâ€™s Crypto Task Force, â€œIf the SEC were to provide guidance on distributions, it would stem the tide of [tokens] only
being issued to non-U.S. persons â€” a trend that is effectively offshoring ownership of blockchain technologies developed in the U.S.â€(cid:157) Maybe this time, theyâ€™ll listen. Magazine: Memecoins are ded â€” But Solana â€˜100x betterâ€™ despite revenue plunge
Ripple is celebrating the United States Securities and Exchange Commissionâ€™s (SEC) decision not to pursue a court case against the firm, but it provides little legal certainty for the crypto industry.Â The US financial regulator has apparently dropped an appeal against Ripple, the issuing firm of crypto asset XRP. The industry saw the case as a prime example of regulatory overreach by the SEC under former chair Gary Gensler. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the decision
â€œprovides a lot of certainty for RIppleâ€(cid:157) and that while the case is effectively over, there are still some loose ends the firm needs to tie up with the SEC. â€œWe now are in the driverâ€™s seat to determine how we want to proceed.â€(cid:157) Stuart Alderoty, Rippleâ€™s chief legal officer, wrote on X, â€œToday, Ripple moves forward â€” stronger than ever. This landmark case set a precedent for the domestic crypto industry.â€(cid:157) Ripple and the crypto industry as a whole are counting
this as a major victory, but the SECâ€™s decision provides no legal precedent, and the â€œguardrailsâ€(cid:157) the industry has lobbied for are yet to be defined.Â The cryptocurrency lobby was quick to celebrate the SEC decision, announced by Garlinghouse at the Digital Asset Summit in New York on March 19. Markets took notice â€” XRP price spiked 9% in the first hour following the announcement. Supporters and observers posted on X about the precedent the case would set for the
crypto industry. But legal observers are less certain about the overall impact the SECâ€™s appeal decision will have on the broader crypto industry. Lawyer Aaron Brogan told Cointelegraph that the Ripple case â€œcreates no precedent that any other firm can rely on.â€(cid:157) He added there is â€œno question that the regulatory environment is more favorable to crypto firms today,â€(cid:157) but the SECâ€™s exact policy wonâ€™t become clear until Paul Atkins is nominated as chair of the
commission. Related: Crypto regulation must go through Congress for lasting change â€” Wiley Nickel Brian Grace, general counsel at the Metaplex Decentralized Autonomous Organization, further noted that the 2023 decision to which the SEC was appealing does not set a legal precedent. He wrote on March 19, â€œThe Ripple decision is not binding legal precedent. It was a single district court judgeâ€™s ruling based on the facts of that case.â€(cid:157)Â The SEC appeal repeal also has
limited influence on the ongoing legislative efforts to create a framework for the cryptocurrency industry in the US. Grace said that the onus is on Congress, not the SEC, to make lasting legal changes for the cryptocurrency industry.Â â€œThe U.S. crypto industry needs new legislation to provide clarity and protection. Without it, the Plaintiffs bar can continue to sue in district courts across the country relying on Howey. A friendly SEC also does not change this. We need a crypto
market structure law,â€(cid:157) he said.Â Brogan said that he didnâ€™t think the decision would have any direct effect on the lawmaking process, but the SEC could still solve questions regarding rulemaking. â€œI think many in Congress would welcome that as the market structure legislation currently percolating appears dead in the water,â€(cid:157) he said. The SEC appeal decision may put the â€œfinal exclamation pointâ€(cid:157) on whether XRP is a security, but the legal battle between Ripple
and the SEC could be set to rage on. In a March 19 Bloomberg interview, Garlinghouse brought up the possibility of going on the offensive with a cross-appeal, i.e. an appeal from an appellee requesting that a higher court review a lower courtâ€™s decision.Â Related: Bitnomial drops SEC lawsuit ahead of XRP futures launch in the US Namely, Garlinghouse wants to revisit the 2023 decision in which Judge Analisa Torres, while ruling Rippleâ€™s publicly sold tokens did not constitute
a security, levied a $125 million fine on Ripple, stating that the tokens should have been sold to institutional investors.Â The firm is also subject to a five-year â€œbad actorâ€(cid:157) prohibition on fundraising which, says Brogan, could meaningfully impact its operations.Â â€œAt this point, all weâ€™re fighting for is do we want to fight to get the $125 million back,â€(cid:157) said Garlinghouse. He added that while the XRP-securities decision was a â€œclear legal victory,â€(cid:157) there are
â€œpieces of it that we think could be kind of cleaned up. And the question is, do we want to fight that fight? Or can we come to an agreement with the SEC to drop everything?â€(cid:157) Outside of the courtroom, Congress is still working to make meaningful progress on the stablecoin bill. Bo Hines, the executive director of the Presidentâ€™s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, expects the final version to be ready in a couple of months.Â The crypto framework bill FIT 21 failed to
make it through the Senate in the 2024 legislative session, but some lawmakers are optimistic that it will make it through this session with â€œmodest changes.â€(cid:157) The Blockchain Association, a crypto lobby group, expects both laws to pass by August, while US Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, says they could be finalized by yearâ€™s end.Â Magazine: Memecoins are ded â€” But Solana â€˜100x betterâ€™ despite revenue plunge
Telegram founder Pavel Durov has been allowed to leave France temporarily, but the preliminary charges against him raise significant questions for the crypto community. On March 13, a French court gave the founder and CEO of the encrypted messaging app Telegram permission to leave for Dubai, where he had previously resided. Durov had been in France since August 2024, when he was arrested at the Le Bourget airport in Paris.Â Durov was part of an investigation containing
allegations of negligence and complicity in crimes like narcotics trafficking, money laundering, child sexual exploitation and terrorism. He could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. More broadly, Durovâ€™s case raises questions about developer responsibility for the cryptographic platforms and tools they create â€” a well-known issue in the cryptocurrency industry. The preliminary charges against Durov claimed he was responsible, at least in part, for the illicit activities
allegedly enabled by the platformâ€™s encryption and support for cryptocurrencies.Â The argument will sound familiar to crypto industry observers, who have been following the case of Alexey Pertsev, the developer of cryptocurrency mixer service Tornado Cash. As with Durov, prosecutors allege that Pertsev is responsible for the illicit activities that took place on the platform, namely money laundering.Â Pertsev was arrested in the Netherlands in 2022 and is currently out on
bail while he waits for his trial to begin. Related: Tornado Cash dev Alexey Pertsevâ€™s bail a â€˜crucial stepâ€™ in getting fair trial, defense says In both cases, members of the crypto community have recognized the possible implications to free speech and privacy, and have come to support the executives.Â Jose Fabrega, head of marketing at Ethereum-based blockchain Metis, called Durovâ€™s arrest the â€œTornado Cash case all over again.â€(cid:157) Source: Jose Fabrega Natalia
Latka, director of public policy and regulatory affairs at blockchain analysis firm Merkle Science, previously told Cointelegraph that â€œhistorically, software developers were seen as neutral creators of tools and platforms, responsible for their technical functionality but not for how those tools were used.â€(cid:157) However, she said this has been changing with the proliferation of decentralized tools that â€œchallenge traditional regulatory frameworks.â€(cid:157) This puts decentralized
platforms in a â€œtight spot,â€(cid:157) crypto platform Onesafe wrote in a blog post on March 17. â€œThis means knowing the legal frameworks governing their operations and engaging with regulatory bodies.â€(cid:157) It also called the Durov case a â€œpivotal momentâ€(cid:157) for the cryptocurrency industry and called on crypto firms to advocate for more â€œbalanced regulationsâ€(cid:157) and support advocacy groups.Â Durov himself wrote on March 17 that Telegram has â€œnot only met but
exceeded its legal obligations.â€(cid:157)Â Observers and critics alike have raised concerns about Durovâ€™s arrest, discussing what it means for free speech and whether the arrest could have been politically motivated.Â Â Chris Pavlovski, CEO of â€œalt-techâ€(cid:157) video-sharing platform Rumble, said that it was the final straw for him and his company, which had previously clashed with French officials over censorship issues.Â Source: Chris PavlolvskiÂ Gregory Alburov, an investigator for
the Anti-Corruption Foundation of late Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, said that â€œin addition to being unjust as hell (Durov obviously isnâ€™t engaged in terrorism or weapons trafficking), [the case] is also a huge blow to freedom of speech.â€(cid:157) Durovâ€™s previous clashes with regulators, particularly in 2018, when he refused to comply with an order from Russian telecoms regulator Roskomnadzor, have led many to believe that the charges were politically
motivated.Â While French President Emmanuel Macron publicly stated that the case is not an attack on Durov, Dmitry Zair-Bek â€” a human rights lawyer and head of the human rights organization Department One â€” disagrees.Â Related: Free speech and online privacy: Pavel Durovâ€™s rise to the top â€œDurov is essentially being targeted for his efforts to protect usersâ€™ privacy and, of course, for his refusal to cooperate with intelligence agencies,â€(cid:157) he said.Â Regardless
of the motivations, the outcome of the case will have clear implications for future platforms. A conviction could intimidate platforms and executives into more intense moderation to the point of censorship, while a victory could embolden others to abandon obligations to regulators and public safety.Â Durovâ€™s leave in Dubai reportedly extends to April 7.

Over the ages, property ownership has survived the fall of empires, endured technological revolutions and kept pace with shifting social tides. The business of land and buildings has shown a remarkable knack for adaptation, and blockchain stands as a powerful tool for the real estate industry to address and overcome the challenges of the modern world. Real estate â€” a market expected to hit $654 trillion by 2025 â€” has long been considered one of the most stable investment
options. Yet, the barriers to investing remain high for the broader population. Starting with high upfront capital requirements, rigid regulations and protracted settlement processes, these challenges deter all but the most well-funded or persistent buyers. Additionally, the traditional property market is illiquid, often taking months or even years to complete a sale. This is where blockchain â€” and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization â€” enters. Simply put, RWA tokenization in real
estate is the process of converting ownership of a property or its related cash flows into digital tokens on a blockchain. These tokens represent the value of the underlying asset in the form of absolute ownership of a single property to fractional shares or specific rights to rental income. The key advantage of RWA tokenization is that it enables liquidity in an otherwise illiquid market â€” allowing tokens to be traded 24/7 across a global network â€” while enhancing transparency,
security and efficiency. However, potential adopters still face concerns about regulatory compliance, technological complexity and data authenticity â€” challenges that go well beyond simply digitizing a property deed. The full realization of RWA tokenizationâ€™s potential requires real estate participants to navigate legal frameworks and industry standards, ensuring that everything from fractional ownership rights to security measures and investor protections aligns with regional
and international regulations. Mantra, a layer-1 blockchain built for RWA tokenization, stands at the forefront of bringing real estate business to blockchain by tokenizing property. Built on the Cosmos SDK, Mantra provides the necessary infrastructure, compliance features and liquidity solutions to bridge the gap between traditional assets and blockchain technology. The platform was specifically engineered to address three core challenges in real estate tokenization: Hereâ€™s a
closer look at how Mantraâ€™s toolkit simplifies the tokenization process for developers, institutions and individual investors: Real estate is heavily regulated, with laws differing across jurisdictions. Rather than relying on cumbersome offchain processes, Mantra allows users to undergo Know Your Customer (KYC) verification within its blockchain environment with its Digital Identity (DID) system. Following a phased rollout, this system will issue a soulbound NFT to those
undergoing the KYC process. Ensuring only verified users can transact will significantly reduce compliance hurdles. ðŸŽ™ï¸(cid:143)INSIGHT: Tokenization went from rebellion to revolution, now itâ€™s the evolution of finance.At Consensus HK, @MANTRA_chain co-founder @jayantramanand shared how they built an L1 blockchain to power compliant, composable tokenization for real-world assets.In 2017,â€¦ pic.twitter.com/uvx21SRGBZ Meanwhile, Mantra Token Service (MTS) includes
features like freezing, seizing or burning tokens â€” vital for aligning onchain activity with real-world legal mandates. To avoid liquidity fragmentation â€” RWA liquidity being scattered across multiple networks â€” Mantra supports Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) Protocol, facilitating seamless asset transfer between blockchains. As a manifestation of its commitment to compliance, Mantra applies to licenses where it operates. The project recently received a license to
provide services as a virtual asset exchange, broker-dealer and management and investment servicer in Dubai from the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). As the first DeFi platform to achieve this, it signaled the start of a new regulatory era. Regulatory compliance often goes hand in hand with daunting paperwork. Mantra aims to streamline the time-intensive process long associated with regulatory compliance, with its DID system. New users undergo a KYC check just
once, after which they receive a passportable identity confirmation that can be used across the ecosystem. This identity binds them to a Mantra wallet address and mitigates the need for repeated verification. From there, the platformâ€™s user-friendly dashboard guides users through everything from token creation to asset management. The emphasis on simplicity empowers experienced investors and newcomers to participate in real estate tokenization without feeling
overwhelmed by technical details or cumbersome red tape. When a real estate developer seeks financing for a premium commercial complex, it can utilize the Mantra ecosystem in addition to traditional fundraising methods. Real estate has the potential to massively benefit from tokenization thanks to its massive global market size and stability, as well as traditionally high barriers to entry. Transforming property ownership into blockchain-based tokens will improve access to
liquidity, enabling investors to buy and sell real estate assets more easily, and in near real time. It also lowers the capital threshold for participation, attracting a broader range of investors and developers. Real estate that is tokenized using the Mantra suite provides a secure and verifiable record of ownership and enables fractional ownership models at scale. It is a combination that signals an accessible and capital-efficient era of property investment and positions real estate as a
frontrunner among RWAs moving onchain. Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

Today in crypto, Ledgerâ€™s Ian Rogers says the battle between crypto security advancements and hackers will never end, Pakistanâ€™s Crypto Council proposes mining BTC with excess, runoff energy, and crypto analysts anticipate continued pressure owing to trading wars until April. Cryptocurrency wallet providers are getting more sophisticated, but so are bad actors â€” which means the battle between security and threats is at a deadlock, says a hardware wallet firm
executive. â€œIt will always be a cat and mouse game,â€(cid:157) Ledger chief experience officer Ian Rogers told Cointelegraph when describing the constant race between crypto wallet firms adding new security features and hackers finding more advanced ways to access victimsâ€™ wallets.

The current Bitcoin BTC $84,457 Bitcoin Change (24h) 0.07% Market Cap $1.67T Volume (24h) $19.37B View More bear market, defined as a 20% or more drop from the all-time high, is relatively weak in terms of magnitude and should only last for 90 days, according to market analyst and the author of Metcalfe's Law as a Model for Bitcoin's Value, Timothy Peterson. Peterson compared the current downturn to the 10 previous bear markets, which occur roughly once per year,
and said that only four bear markets have been worse than the price decline in terms of duration, including 2018, 2021, 2022, and 2024. The analyst predicted that BTC will not sink deeply below the $50,000 price level due to the underlying adoption trends. However, Peterson also argued that based on momentum, it is unlikely that BTC will break below $80,000. The analyst added: Crypto markets experienced a sharp downturn following United States President Trump's tariffs on
several US trading partners, which sparked counter-tariffs on US exports, leading to fears of a prolonged trade war. Comparison of every bear market since 2025.

According to Nansen research analyst Nicolai Sondergaard, crypto markets will face trade war pressures until April 2025, when international negotiations could potentially lower or diffuse the trade tariffs altogether. A recent analysis from CryptoQuant also shows that a majority of retail traders are already invested in BTC, dashing long-held hopes that a massive rush of retail traders would inject fresh capital into
the markets and push prices higher in the near term.

Bilal Bin Saqib, the CEO of Pakistan's Crypto Council, has proposed using the country's runoff energy to fuel Bitcoin mining at the Crypto Council's inaugural meeting on March 21. According to an article from The Nation, the council is exploring comprehensive regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies to attract foreign direct investment and establish Pakistan as a crypto hub. The meeting included lawmakers, the Bank of Pakistan's governor, the chairman of Pakistan's Securities
and Exchange Commission (SECP), and the federal information technology secretary. Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb had this to say about the meeting: The Crypto Council represents a radical departure from the government of Pakistan's previous stance on crypto. In May 2023, former minister of state for finance and revenue, Aisha Ghaus Pasha said crypto would never be legal in the country. Pasha cited anti-money laundering restrictions under the Financial Action Task Force
(FATF) as the primary motivation for the government's anti-crypto stance. The presence of Bitcoin miners can stabilize electrical grids.

Opinion by: Ido Ben Natan, co-founder and CEO of Blockaid Centralized exchanges (CEXs) have controlled what people can trade for years. If a token wasnâ€™t listed on major exchanges, it didnâ€™t exist for most users. That system worked when crypto was small. But today? Itâ€™s completely broken. The rise of Solana-based memecoins, the popularization of projects like Pump.fun and developments in AI-driven token creation are driving the creation of millions of new tokens
each month.Â Exchanges have not evolved to keep up. That must change. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong recently weighed in on the topic, saying that exchanges must shift from an allowlist model to a blocklist model, where everything is tradeable unless flagged as a scam. In many ways, this is the Kodak moment for CEXs. Kodakâ€™s failure to adapt to digital photography has made it a poster child of failed strategy. Now, exchanges are faced with the same threat. The old way of
doing things isnâ€™t just slow â€” itâ€™s obsolete. The real question is: What comes next? CEXs were initially built to make crypto feel safe and familiar. They modeled their approach after traditional stock markets â€” carefully vetting every token before it could be listed. This system was designed to protect users and keep regulators happy. Crypto, however, does not function like the stock market. Unlike stocks, which require months of filings and approvals before going public,
anyone can create a token instantly. Exchanges simply canâ€™t keep up. The recent launch of the TRUMP coin is a great example. It launched on Jan. 17 and immediately skyrocketed in value, but by the time it had been listed on significant CEXs, it was already past its peak. Recent: Bybit hack a setback for institutional staking adoption: Everstake exec For exchanges, this isnâ€™t just an efficiency problem â€” itâ€™s a fight for survival. The rules they were built on donâ€™t fit
cryptoâ€™s reality anymore. To compete, they must reinvent themselves before the market leaves them behind. Instead of fighting to preserve outdated listing processes, exchanges should embrace the open access of DEXs while retaining the best parts of centralized trading. Users simply want to trade, regardless of whether an asset is officially â€œlisted.â€(cid:157) The most successful exchanges will remove the need for listings altogether. Listing tokens faster is not enough when the
future is an open-access model. This new generation of exchanges wonâ€™t just list tokens â€” theyâ€™ll index them in real-time. Every token created onchain will be automatically recognized, with exchanges sourcing liquidity and price feeds directly from decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Instead of waiting for manual approvals, users will have access to any asset the moment it exists. Access alone isnâ€™t enough â€” trading has to be seamless. Future exchanges will integrate
onchain execution and embedded self-custody wallets, enabling users to purchase tokens just as easily as they do today. Features like magic spend will enable exchanges to fund self-custodial accounts on demand, converting fiat into the required onchain currency, routing trades through the best available liquidity and securing assets without users needing to manage private keys or interact with multiple platforms. Nothing will change from the userâ€™s perspective â€” but
everything will be different. A trader will simply click â€œbuy,â€(cid:157) and the exchange will handle everything in the background. They wonâ€™t know if the token was ever â€œlistedâ€(cid:157) in the traditional sense â€” they wouldnâ€™t need to know. Shifting from an allowlist to a blocklist is the first step toward a more open-access model for CEXs. Rather than deciding which tokens users can trade, exchanges would only block scams or malicious assets. While this shift makes trading
more efficient, it also presents significant security and compliance challenges. Threats will constantly test the system, and effective protections must be implemented. Regulators expect CEXs to enforce compliance more strictly than DEXs. Removing manual listing will require real-time monitoring to halt transactions involving high-risk assets or illicit activity. Security cannot be reactive; it must be proactive, near-instant and automated. Open-access trading may be too risky for users
and exchanges without this foundation. The way CEXs operate today isnâ€™t built for the future. A manual approval process for token listings doesnâ€™t scale, and as DEXs continue to gain ground, the old model is becoming a competitive disadvantage. The logical next step is moving to a blocklist model, where all tokens are tradable by default except those flagged as malicious or non-compliant. To survive, CEXs should work to replace slow, manual reviews with real-time threat
detection, onchain security monitoring and compliance automation. The exchanges that get this transition right â€” the ones that integrate security at the core of an open-access model â€” will lead the next era of crypto. The ones that donâ€™t? Theyâ€™ll be left trying to compete with DEXs while still using a system that no longer fits the market. Opinion by: Ido Ben Natan, co-founder and CEO of Blockaid.

Opinion by: Brendon Sedo, Core DAO initial contributor Bitcoin is outgrowing the â€œdigital goldâ€(cid:157) narrative. The primary driver of this shift is the rise of Bitcoin DeFi (BTCfi), which looks beyond the mere store-of-value use cases.Â In 2024, Bitcoin BTC $84,455 Bitcoin Change (24h) 0.07% Market Cap $1.67T Volume (24h) $19.37B View More became a natively yield-generating asset and the centerpiece of Ethereum-style decentralized finance ecosystems. 2025 is when that
kindling can grow its flame on innovative Bitcoin sidechains.Â Most past attempts to tap Bitcoinâ€™s value as a productive asset required significant changes to its base layer. Thatâ€™s a big reason they failed. The Bitcoin layer 1 is not designed for much change, leaving most Bitcoiners to merely hodl and not do much else. The result is that Bitcoin remained underutilized as a network and an asset. Bitcoin sidechains have emerged as the perfect solution to all these problems,
scaling Bitcoinâ€™s utility without altering or being limited by the base layer. Naturally, these protocols will be the most potent catalyst for BTCfiâ€™s growth, especially with BTC surpassing $100,000, constituting over 60% of the total crypto market share, and entering a new regulatory landscape with the first â€œpro-cryptoâ€(cid:157) US government regime. Per Hal Finney, â€œBitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction [â€¦] included in the blockchain.â€(cid:157)
Thatâ€™s why thereâ€™s a need for a secondary level of paymentâ€™ in his view.Â For a long time, the blockchain space ignored Finneyâ€™s call to action and prioritized innovation that isolated Bitcoin. However, innovations previously limited to chains like Ethereum are now crossing over to the world of Bitcoin. Sidechains, rollups and other scaling solutions offer more options for holders who want Ethereum-style utility while remaining aligned with Bitcoin. This prepared the
ground for BTCfi, where holders can access a range of income-generating solutions like staking, lending and derivatives.Â The industry is, however, still in the early innings of this revolution in Bitcoin. As of November 2024, merely 0.8% of its circulating supply is utilized for DeFi use cases, according to Galaxy Digital. Out of Bitcoinâ€™s roughly $2 trillion market cap, less than $7 billion comprises BTCfi TVL. While this may appear unencouraging, it highlights the massive remaining
opportunity. Bitcoin L2 infrastructure scaled 7x from 2021 to November 2024.Â Recent: Bitcoin DeFi TVL up 2,000% amid bumper 2024 for BTC price, adoption More importantly, it has accounted for a sizable share of new liquidity flowing into BTC, besides institutional products like exchange-traded funds (ETFs).Â Even if the supply of Bitcoin in BTCfi platforms and sidechains grows by 0.25% annually, the sector will have a total addressable market of $44 billion to $47 billion by
2030, according to Galaxy Digital. However, as Bitcoiners know, this is a conservative estimate and would be accelerated by accelerating BTC price action or even more Bitcoin DeFi adoption.Â VCs, for one, have started to recognize the potential of Bitcoin sidechains, investing over $447 million already, according to Galaxy Digital. Of this, about $174 million was invested in Q3 2024, setting the stage for more explosive growth in 2025. More funding for early-stage projects will
ensure more successful launches, innovations, choices for users, and overall value.Â As Bitcoin-native solutions provide access to productive use cases for Bitcoin, users will no longer need to rely on trusted intermediaries and Bitcoin-agnostic smart contract platforms. Sacrifices that were necessary to expand the utility of Bitcoin in the past will no longer be required. That can unlock substantial value for principled BTC holders and even the Bitcoin network itself.Â So far, bridging
to Turing-complete Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains has been a go-to way to facilitate yields and other financial use cases on Bitcoin. For example, the wrapped Bitcoin WBTC $84,327.66 Wrapped Bitcoin Change (24h) 0.11% Market Cap $11.17B Volume (24h) $37.75M View More market on Ethereum is more than $10 billion. While solutions like WBTC have been suitable for some, many Bitcoin holders prefer not to entrust custodians with their capital or rely on chains
like Ethereum, which do not align with Bitcoin's consensus principles or support the network at all.Â BTCfi, defined by Bitcoin-aligned and Bitcoin-powered infrastructure, is a solution from which both WBTC users and Bitcoin purists can benefit. Users who are already accustomed to Ethereumâ€™s smart contract sophistication can continue to enjoy that EVM experience while also growing closer to Bitcoinâ€™s roots. Principled Bitcoin users can get more options for their BTCâ€™s
utility if the sidechain aligns with the base network.Â Bitcoin holders also gain access to BTC derivatives superior to Ethereum-native solutions like WBTC. Yield-bearing BTC derivatives on Bitcoin-aligned sidechains are a 100x improvement, offering self-custody and previously unavailable yield sources to Bitcoin holders.Â Overall, BTCfi can be much more significant. Not just compared to where it is now, but also vis-a-vis EVM and SVM-based DeFi. Bitcoin sidechains are already
driving this shift, and will continue to do so throughout 2025. All that is needed is the right approach and consistency regarding development and product pipelines. For BTCfi, the path is clear: Deliver use cases with product-market fit to Bitcoin holders on Bitcoin-powered platforms. This will lay the foundation for generating even more value for the Bitcoin community as a whole. And ultimately, there will be a positive flywheel of Bitcoin adoption.Â The institutional side led
headlines in 2024. Now, itâ€™s time for the native, onchain camp to show its strength and deliver.Â Opinion by: Brendon Sedo, Core DAO initial contributor.
